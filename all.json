By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is glimpsing past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language; however, they also show Holmberg’s interest in concepts of absence, transparency, and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, particularly his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture illuminates how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/","duration":94,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":104750005,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/104750005","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":8,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487379368_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487379368_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487379368_100x75.jpg","title":"James Holmberg: Forever","upload_date":"2014-08-29 15:48:36","url":"http://vimeo.com/104750005","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Exhibition Dates: July 18 - September 28, 2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEric William Carroll presents the second installment of his ongoing project “G.U.T. Feeling.” Grand Unified Theory (G.U.T.) is a new photographic installation that revels in the ardent striving of science’s grandest theories—the search by fringe and mainstream scientists alike for a single elegant explanation of the universe. Images from his own scientific experiments and found footage bridge the gap between epic and mundane, suggestive of grand ideas without proving a thing. Two gallery-length tables emphasize the connection between his photographs and the wonderfully obsolete technologies once used to visualize scientific observation.

Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets. These pictures are meticulously composed down to the slightest gestures and period styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouglas was awarded the prestigious Infinity Award for Art by the International Center for Photography in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Arnold Neman Lecture Series is made possible thanks to a generous gift from the Arnold and Augusta Newman Foundation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerous support for New Pictures is provided by the W.

Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.","duration":137,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":99355376,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/99355376","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":222,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_100x75.jpg","title":"Monica Haller | Beneath the Ground","upload_date":"2014-06-27 13:12:13","url":"http://vimeo.com/99355376","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"In this exhibition, simply titled \"Sacred,\" curators have assembled art from every corner of the world.

Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.

These atmospheric works reveal the ambiguity between the interior built space and exterior natural space evoked by Johnson's home. These pictures suggest a physical experience of space and form that is unique in architectural photography.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJames Welling has been producing groundbreaking work since the 1970s that possesses a rare combination of conceptual depth and technical skill. Through the last three decades, he continues to challenge himself as a photographer and offers viewers new discoveries through thoughtful and visually arresting photographs that suggest overlooked aspects of the medium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the last five years, he has taken on the challenge of architecture and produced a body of work that offers a new take on representations of architecture within a natural site.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":1,"stats_number_of_plays":72,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in magazines and books.","duration":153,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134389,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134389","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":33,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469156337_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469156337_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469156337_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 5: Jason Fulford","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:35","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134389","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Friday, April 20, 2012—Sunday, August 5, 2012<br />\r\nLinda and Lawrence Perlman Gallery (262)<br />\r\nFree Exhibition<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs part of our \"New Pictures\" series devoted to innovation in contemporary photography, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts invited British photographer Martin Parr to cross the pond and shoot photos covering the wealth of winter activities in Minnesota, from pond hockey to ice fishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe results of his endeavor are on view in his exhibition, \"New Pictures 6: Martin Parr,\" opening April 20 in the Linda and Lawrence Perlman Gallery (262).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member of the esteemed Magnum Photos, an international photographers' cooperative, Parr is one of the most renowned and celebrated photographers working today.
