Students use wooden crates to symbolize the immigrant population that came to Minnesota to work in the fields. Each ofrenda reflects the student's own experience.\n\nThe project Web site and blog, of which this video is a part of, follows the progress of the students in creating their ofrendas. They relate their perspectives and insights as they honor their ancestors. Their final ofrendas and videos are on view in the exhibition Young People's Ofrendas: Expressions of Life and Remembrance at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, October 16 through November 14, 2010.\n\nWeek 3: The Final Narrative. This week students start to decorate their ofrendas, using materials they have collected during the first two weeks. Some students may make personal drawings, while others may create small, ceramic sculpture.\n\nhttp://www.artsmia.org/ofrenda","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/1zxFvOemjFM/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"1zxFvOemjFM","title":"Alexandra - Young People's Ofrenda 2010 - Week 3: Final Narrative","upload_date":"20101025","extractor":"youtube","like_count":0,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Alexandra - Young People's Ofrenda 2010 - Week 3: Final Narrative","url":"https://r6---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?mt=1395161897&upn=tss7xb-f4X8&source=youtube&mv=m&signature=AC29219CB2589A753DE455E0BFF768E82C58B9D3.388C23FF10BC325B42B172953F2328E4E028FEFC&itag=18&ipbits=0&ms=au&requiressl=yes&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&key=yt5&expire=1395187767&ip=207.250.46.170&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&id=d73c45bce7a68c53&sver=3&ratebypass=yes","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zxFvOemjFM","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":133,"playlist_index":266,"fulltitle":"Alexandra - Young People's Ofrenda 2010 - Week 3: Final Narrative","duration":"85"},{"format":"22 - 1280x720","description":"Phase 4: Write an Artist's Statement—With their ofrendas near completion, students write narratives about their ofrendas, which are used as the label texts for the exhibition, printed in both Spanish and English.\n\nLearn more about the Young People's Ofrenda Project at the MIA at http://www.artsmia.org/ofrenda","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/dpLKFCCrfbg/maxresdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"dpLKFCCrfbg","title":"Alexandra - Young People's Ofrenda 2012 - Phase Four","upload_date":"20121030","extractor":"youtube","like_count":0,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Alexandra - Young People's Ofrenda 2012 - Phase Four","url":"https://r2---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?ipbits=0&ip=207.250.46.170&requiressl=yes&mt=1395161810&signature=D79F936D13934F3D0CB050875DA1AD1CA09560E9.61329BED283FBD93AC551E935060A29037943AF5&sver=3&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&upn=Dt_pRlDtMcU&expire=1395184794&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&id=7692ca1420ab7db8&key=yt5&source=youtube&ratebypass=yes&mv=m&itag=22&ms=au","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpLKFCCrfbg","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"22","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":12,"playlist_index":104,"fulltitle":"Alexandra - Young People's Ofrenda 2012 - Phase Four","duration":"96"},{"format":"22 - 1280x720","description":"In the months leading up to the opening of his MAEP exhibition \"Verbatim,\" St. Paul--based artist Allen Brewer collected short written descriptions of artwork by MIA visitors.

Taking that collection as a departure point, this exhibition brings attention to the museum's modest but notable holdings of design from the post-World War II era to the present. American and European designers over the last six decades have explored abstraction of form, new technologies, new materials, and adventurous colors in items for household use. This exhibition focuses on these developments through over thirty examples of furniture, industrial design, jewelry, and other consumer objects, including notable recent acquisitions.

Tyranny describes the influence optics has had, and continues to have, in the production, interpretation, and distribution of images since the early 15th century. Falco shares findings on how optics reveals new insights into the creative process of visual artists and demonstrates that artists, not scientists, were among the first to employ it.\n\nA renowned physicist, Charles Falco has written bestselling books on art and optics with artist David Hockney. He is the chair of Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Arizona, where he has been a professor of optical sciences and research professor in the Surface Science Division of the universitys Arizona Research Laboratories since 1982.\n\nPresented in conjunction with the MIAs monthly Third Thursday event.","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Kuk3wDMl_0Y/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":1,"id":"Kuk3wDMl_0Y","title":"Charles Falco: The Tyranny of the Lens","upload_date":"20090422","extractor":"youtube","like_count":6,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Charles Falco: The Tyranny of the Lens","url":"https://r6---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?mv=m&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&source=youtube&upn=hMsU5UgimGI&key=yt5&requiressl=yes&ip=207.250.46.170&mt=1395161988&expire=1395186332&ratebypass=yes&itag=18&signature=D1906CA4F737FDE77BCD1FED76EAE38470A66DB7.F8079B707030EA97B9E96E29FE9D4F57763E7BDF&ipbits=0&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&sver=3&id=2ae937c03325ff46&ms=au","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuk3wDMl_0Y","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":4717,"playlist_index":361,"fulltitle":"Charles Falco: The Tyranny of the Lens","duration":"4507"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Phase 4: Write an Artist's Statement—With their ofrendas near completion, students write narratives about their ofrendas, which are used as the label texts for the exhibition, printed in both Spanish and English.\n\nLearn more about the Young People's Ofrenda Project at the MIA at http://www.artsmia.org/ofrenda","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/m0ysXVfLToc/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"m0ysXVfLToc","title":"Cheyenne - Young People's Ofrenda 2011 - Phase Four","upload_date":"20111101","extractor":"youtube","like_count":0,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Cheyenne - Young People's Ofrenda 2011 - Phase Four","url":"https://r2---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?key=yt5&ip=207.250.46.170&itag=18&sver=3&mv=m&mt=1395161897&source=youtube&ms=au&ratebypass=yes&requiressl=yes&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&signature=1693F1EB29E84D8E21CD07296F4ED364A5A340F9.76525C8EA7BB6F871669FBAA15AD0CBE00DA6887&expire=1395183066&ipbits=0&upn=QNHeDuitqfA&id=9b4cac5d57cb4e87&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0ysXVfLToc","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":22,"playlist_index":218,"fulltitle":"Cheyenne - Young People's Ofrenda 2011 - Phase Four","duration":"80"},{"format":"22 - 1280x720","description":"Get a glimpse into the life and legacy of China's First Emperor. And see over 120 rare objects—including 8 terracotta tomb warriors and 2 horses—and other amazing artifacts from this extraordinary archaeological excavation.\n\nA once-in-a-lifetime experience, this exhibition takes visitors on a journey from the birth and rise of the Qin Empire to the life and rule of the First Emperor, his quest for immortality, and his death, burial, and legacy. This is a rare opportunity to view treasures from one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of our time, drawn from more than 13 institutions in China, including the Museum of Terracotta Warriors and Horses, the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Institute, and the Shaanxi History Museum. A presentation of objects, including bronze ritual and jade artifacts, gold and silver ornaments, and palatial architectural components, illustrates the emergence of the Qin State more than 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe MIA was among the first museums outside China to feature some of these figures in a small display held in 1985. A quarter-century later, Chinese archaeologists are still toiling away around the burial mound of one of the most remarkable figures in the history of China, the First Emperor. Don't miss your chance to learn more about this extraordinarily influential man.","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HQ9qvxtd1h4/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"HQ9qvxtd1h4","title":"China's Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor's Legacy","upload_date":"20121129","extractor":"youtube","like_count":3,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"China's Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor's Legacy","url":"https://r3---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?signature=E35B3D2F0CAD2FC9631DB61223958D3B526F1FFC.F8C8862D203EEFA2FB0C44E958FBEC099F92C835&requiressl=yes&id=1d0f6abf1b5dd61e&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&source=youtube&upn=eD1g0l1TuDE&expire=1395182531&mv=m&mt=1395161810&ms=au&key=yt5&ip=207.250.46.170&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&ipbits=0&itag=22&sver=3&ratebypass=yes","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ9qvxtd1h4","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"22","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":890,"playlist_index":70,"fulltitle":"China's Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor's Legacy","duration":"32"},{"format":"22 -

Students use wooden crates to symbolize the immigrant population that came to Minnesota to work in the fields. Each ofrenda reflects the student's own experience.\n\nThe project Web site and blog, of which this video is a part of, follows the progress of the students in creating their ofrendas. They relate their perspectives and insights as they honor their ancestors. Their final ofrendas and videos are on view in the exhibition Young People's Ofrendas: Expressions of Life and Remembrance at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, October 16 through November 14, 2010.\n\nWeek 3: The Final Narrative. This week students start to decorate their ofrendas, using materials they have collected during the first two weeks. Some students may make personal drawings, while others may create small, ceramic sculpture.\n\nhttp://www.artsmia.org/ofrenda","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/MkobIQoMUjM/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"MkobIQoMUjM","title":"Cristian - Young People's Ofrenda 2010 - Week 3: Final Narrative","upload_date":"20101025","extractor":"youtube","like_count":0,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Cristian - Young People's Ofrenda 2010 - Week 3: Final Narrative","url":"https://r2---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?key=yt5&sver=3&id=o-ANjf4bpSpOQ_gN6qtLvugtxpAOhK1p3qUUb_33hei0Ce&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&expire=1395185636&upn=TTz0hS7BKHI&ms=au&itag=18&ip=207.250.46.170&mv=m&ratebypass=yes&source=youtube&signature=4C231276D9A20B8967F74F54DDD1CE4B7B2ACD3A.499FDDBDCA75F12FE6E087DADDEB00D7D5678B2D&requiressl=yes&ipbits=0&mt=1395161897&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkobIQoMUjM","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":75,"playlist_index":268,"fulltitle":"Cristian - Young People's Ofrenda 2010 - Week 3: Final Narrative","duration":"58"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Phase 1 of Young People's Ofrendas Project: Honoring Ancestors\n\nThis week, students at Austin, El Colegio, and Humboldt high schools are embarking in earnest on the 2013 Young People's Ofrendas project.

Students use wooden crates to symbolize the immigrant population that came to Minnesota to work in the fields. Each ofrenda reflects the student's own experience.\n\nThe project Web site and blog, of which this video is a part of, follows the progress of the students in creating their ofrendas. They relate their perspectives and insights as they honor their ancestors. Their final ofrendas and videos are on view in the exhibition Young People's Ofrendas: Expressions of Life and Remembrance at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, October 16 through November 14, 2010.\n\nWeek 3: The Final Narrative. This week students start to decorate their ofrendas, using materials they have collected during the first two weeks.

The result is a physically light but beautiful, space-filling volume of color. Visitors are encouraged to sit or lie on the \"grass\" and look up into the sun-colored, cascading lengths of yarn. Visitors can also stand in the middle, surrounded by the gradient colors filling the space. Looking at letting go from the second floor, one sees thousands of individual strands, a streaky volume that creates a gently disorienting vibration of color that fills the rotunda's void.\n\nDuring four weeks of construction and installation leading up to the MIA's 2012 Northern Spark event, HOTTEA, MIA staff and volunteers measured, cut, and knotted an estimated 14,000 pieces of colored yarn (almost 400 skeins) to a plastic fence. If laid end-to-end, the yarn would stretch for 82 miles, or put another way, the distance from the MIA to Mankato, Minnesota. If it went straight up into the sky, the yarn would reach past the Kármán Line, the border between Earth's atmosphere and outer space.\n\nVideo shot and edited by Ryan Lee\n\nMUSIC: \"NIGHT OWL\"\nby BROKE FOR FREE\nhttp://freemusicarchive.org/music/Broke_For_Free/\n\nMore from HOTTEA:\n\nFLICKR\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/hotandtea/\n\nVIMEO\nhttps://vimeo.com/user4805654/videos","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XUItBAbW83Y/maxresdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":1,"id":"XUItBAbW83Y","title":"HOTTEA x MIA","upload_date":"20120703","extractor":"youtube","like_count":84,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"HOTTEA x MIA","url":"https://r6---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?ip=207.250.46.170&mt=1395161897&requiressl=yes&ipbits=0&signature=E7F7C81973311D8DB4D94CD9DEB987FF30C9EB1E.DB78751C36A5700F18103674A9061F406BE86952&sver=3&mv=m&ratebypass=yes&source=youtube&ms=au&itag=18&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&expire=1395184422&upn=X_E7ewIUgXE&key=yt5&id=5d422d0406d6f376","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUItBAbW83Y","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":22920,"playlist_index":150,"fulltitle":"HOTTEA x MIA","duration":"170"},{"format":"22 - 1280x720","description":"Phase 3: Write an Artist's Statement—With their ofrendas near completion, students write narratives about their ofrendas, which are used as the label texts for the exhibition, printed in both Spanish and English.\n\nLearn more about the Young People's Ofrenda Project at the MIA at http://new.artsmia.org/ofrenda-2013/","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Q9Dga14L3Mk/maxresdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"Q9Dga14L3Mk","title":"Hannah - Young People's Ofrenda 2013 - Phase Three","upload_date":"20131021","extractor":"youtube","like_count":0,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Hannah - Young People's Ofrenda 2013 - Phase Three","url":"https://r6---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?ms=au&source=youtube&mv=m&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&upn=cBwc2A-kqVg&id=43d0e06b5e0bdcc9&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&signature=E84F080D937ACF62520CBA087B111FE081FF9F6B.A372AF4B5E6EA5C360CE68FDDC7396F80741962A&requiressl=yes&key=yt5&ratebypass=yes&sver=3&ipbits=0&mt=1395161810&itag=22&ip=207.250.46.170&expire=1395183578","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Dga14L3Mk","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"22","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":13,"playlist_index":36,"fulltitle":"Hannah - Young People's Ofrenda 2013 - Phase Three","duration":"37"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Phase 1: Honor Ancestors\n\nStudents explore how artists around the world have expressed reverence for ancestors in artwork and the importance of Day of the Dead in Mexican culture.

Students use wooden crates to symbolize the immigrant population that came to Minnesota to work in the fields. Each ofrenda reflects the student's own experience.\n\nThe project Web site and blog, of which this video is a part of, follows the progress of the students in creating their ofrendas. They relate their perspectives and insights as they honor their ancestors. Their final ofrendas and videos will be on view in an exhibition during the fall of 2010 at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\n\nWeek 1: Selection of Subject.

Her Holy Land series brings ancient stories from the Bible, Torah, and Qur'an to life in a modern Minnesota vernacular. Drawing on stories from these texts, she explores shared traditions and cultures juxtaposed against the complicated political/social present.\n\nRobinsons boldly colored self-portraits create a stage in which she stars as a variety of iconic characters both humorous and surrealistic.

Through repetition, non-linear narratives, and patterns, she creates meditative environments that evaluate time.

Different groups include the Dong, Yi, Yao, Shui, Bouyi, Li, Gejia, and Bai among many others. For thousands of years, these migrating peoples have developed rich, cultural traditions and they are increasingly being recognized for their extraordinary handcrafted textiles and silver jewelry. It is the area of costume where mythology, technical skill, and cultural identity coalesce in vivid aesthetic expression.\n\nUntil recently, most of these remote, ethnic villages were relatively isolated from the majority Han Chinese population. Chinas rapid modernization, however, has penetrated even the minority districts of Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces. The resultant economic, educational, and social changes have already begun to erode the look and use of traditional festive costumes worn by the Miao and other ethnic groups.\n\nIn 1988, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts purchased eleven Miao textiles primarily as a point of contrast with the exceptional collection of Qing dynasty imperial silks owned by the museum. Since that time, the ethnic minority collections have grown to over 1400 textiles and nearly 500 pieces of silver jewelry. Datable primarily to the late 20th century, these works were all added through the generosity of private patrons who provided substantial gifts of funds for purchases, as well as dedicated collectors who donated their private holdings.\n\nIt is hoped that this wonderful collection will add to further appreciation and understanding of China's highly accomplished, ethnic minorities and their art.\n\nhttp://www.artsmia.org/art-of-asia/explore/explore-collection-miao-textiles.cfm\n\nThis video was produced in 2008 by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts with funding from a grant from the The Institute of Museum and Library Services.

But it was with copper that she created her most naturalistic designs. This hammered bowl, like many of her pieces, is based on Chinese metalwork from the T'ang dynasty. The bowl's elegant restraint follows the Arts and Crafts tradition, but its foliate form and tendril-like handles echo the lines and spirit of Art Nouveau. Although Zimmerman made a wide range of objects, from jewelry, flatware, and tea sets to furniture and architectural ornaments, her metalworks are generally considered her finest creations.\n\nPart of the Modernism Web site, featuring objects from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and curator David Ryan, this video was originally produced in 1999. http://www.artsmia.org/modernism/","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lBmqcdCwnuY/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":null,"id":"lBmqcdCwnuY","title":"Modernism: American Art Nouveau - Centerpiece Bowl","upload_date":"20070613","extractor":"youtube","like_count":null,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Modernism: American Art Nouveau - Centerpiece Bowl","url":"https://r6---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?mt=1395161988&upn=H8HPYq93ejc&source=youtube&mv=m&signature=B01A94593DB39412C98B3CE2D7ADEAFACDE0490E.757D61BAE2DA97A674C009AA2B046455A1DFD055&itag=18&ipbits=0&ms=au&requiressl=yes&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&key=yt5&expire=1395188931&ip=207.250.46.170&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&id=9419aa71d0b09ee6&sver=3&ratebypass=yes","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBmqcdCwnuY","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":4542,"playlist_index":380,"fulltitle":"Modernism: American Art Nouveau - Centerpiece Bowl","duration":"65"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Like Gustav Stickley and Elbert Hubbard, Charles Limbert championed the virtues of handmade oak furniture with simple lines and unadorned surfaces.

This table's stretchers have square cutouts in a window-pane configuration, a motif generally attributed to Mackintosh. The dramatically tapering legs, however, are reminiscent of designs by the Vienna Secessionists.

The values of hearth and home--idyllic domesticity--and the virtues of honesty and simplicity became the predominant themes, nature being the constant source of inspiration. While Arts and Crafts ornament led to and overlapped with Art Nouveau decoration, particularly in metalwork and ceramics, furniture designs led almost directly to De Stijl and Bauhaus geometry of the 1920s.

Essential aims were to revive a medieval guild system with high standards of craftsmanship, to instill a pride of craft and to make truth to materials the basis of design. Early proponents (John Ruskin, William Morris and C.F.A. Voysey) espoused joy of labor and a return to simplified, honest forms. Stylized motifs, refined surfaces and proto-Art Nouveau lines were admirably realized in the work of Charles Robert Ashbee and Archibald Knox who eventually abandoned all stylistic imitations to forge a new design vocabulary.\n\nPart of the Modernism Web site, featuring objects from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, this video was originally produced in 1999. http://www.artsmia.org/modernism/","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xVjcyH72Vfo/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":null,"id":"xVjcyH72Vfo","title":"Modernism: British Arts & Crafts","upload_date":"20070613","extractor":"youtube","like_count":null,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Modernism: British Arts & Crafts","url":"https://r2---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?mt=1395161988&sver=3&ratebypass=yes&ip=207.250.46.170&key=yt5&ms=au&ipbits=0&itag=18&source=youtube&mv=m&upn=bRVO1S_AXYY&expire=1395186760&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&signature=FA358D29AA3A3EAF38F75FA16CBE8948D44C71D7.9ADCDBB0B4AC5F9EDEDF47291B4B7965D00ABD71&requiressl=yes&id=c558dcc87ef655fa&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVjcyH72Vfo","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":14844,"playlist_index":377,"fulltitle":"Modernism: British Arts & Crafts","duration":"131"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Dutch for The Style (pronounced the same), De Stijl was the name of a group of artists and architects who gathered around the largely theoretical architect Theo van Doesburg.

The concept was modeled after Charles Robert Ashbee's Guild of Handicraft. By 1905 it had over a hundred craftsmen, its forte being handmade metalware whose reductive style belied its dependence on hand production.

With the protractor he made three semicircular designs--the \"interlace,\" the \"rainbow\" (seen here), and the \"fan\"--which he calls variations I, II, and III. He used these designs as the basis for the many paintings in the Protractor series. Stella named the paintings after circular cities and archaeological sites in the Middle East, where he had traveled in 1963. Tahkt-i-Sulayman is an ancient shrine in Azerbaijan, Iran. But Stella insists that the meaning of his work is purely formal: \"My painting is based on the fact that only what can be seen there is there. It really is an object....

The work will consist of two- and three-dimensional, wall-mounted and freestanding components cut from industrial felt. Throughout her career, Miller has completely transformed gallery and public spaces with her riotously colored installations. The viewer is immediately pulled into the fastidious complexity of her craft and the beauty of natural and manufactured networks; the work seems to crawl, grow, and swallow up space. As a site-specific artist, Miller has spent many hours researching the MIA and its collection. She is especially interested in the Asian, African, and European collections of weapons and armor, and will find creative means to incorporate these objects into her installation.\n\nMore information:\nhttp://www.artsmia.org/index.php?section_id=2&exh_id=3927","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/phxaQ2Sgnq0/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":2,"id":"phxaQ2Sgnq0","title":"Museum in Motion: Installation of Liz Miller's Ornamental Invasion","upload_date":"20110427","extractor":"youtube","like_count":10,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Museum in Motion: Installation of Liz Miller's Ornamental Invasion","url":"https://r3---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?ms=au&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&mt=1395161897&mv=m&id=o-AF4pesRkATXK1E0XsATfCKlJoHp3dOPj1tJq_Udkw4Sb&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&requiressl=yes&ip=207.250.46.170&ratebypass=yes&ipbits=0&expire=1395186755&upn=3IDzO_Xrz68&sver=3&signature=C1104FC1A0067EDDA9FDCD9D819DE75A65650384.B56CEB1E9A5EABBA55D1089DDAB479159502C073&source=youtube&key=yt5&itag=18","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phxaQ2Sgnq0","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":903,"playlist_index":258,"fulltitle":"Museum in Motion: Installation of Liz Miller's Ornamental Invasion","duration":"104"},{"format":"22 -

At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.\n\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.

These atmospheric works reveal the ambiguity between the interior built space and exterior natural space evoked by Johnson's home. These pictures suggest a physical experience of space and form that is unique in architectural photography.\n\nJames Welling has been producing groundbreaking work since the 1970s that possesses a rare combination of conceptual depth and technical skill. Through the last three decades, he continues to challenge himself as a photographer and offers viewers new discoveries through thoughtful and visually arresting photographs that suggest overlooked aspects of the medium.\n\nIn the last five years, he has taken on the challenge of architecture and produced a body of work that offers a new take on representations of architecture within a natural site. His experimental use of color and light to explore spatiality makes him a particularly important artist to feature in the MIA's 'New Pictures' series.\n\nWelling, a professor in the Department of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles, first gained national recognition in the 1970s and 1980s for his carefully staged black-and-white photographs employing such unconventional mediums as pastry dough, gelatin, and tinfoil. These early works spoke to the role of the photographer in staging the vision and narrative of each picture.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.\n\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/QFUKuVo5BbM/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":3,"id":"QFUKuVo5BbM","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"20110317","extractor":"youtube","like_count":14,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","url":"https://r8---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&itag=22&key=yt5&ip=207.250.46.170&sver=3&requiressl=yes&ms=au&source=youtube&mt=1395161897&ratebypass=yes&id=40550ab95a3905b3&expire=1395188208&signature=C860AA73A1341152FCA42727A09E7C0A886C9545.1F7D69E4BAB867687B767DCB0136C5F23BFC4B6E&upn=zJtalaPNah0&ipbits=0&mv=m&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFUKuVo5BbM","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"22","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":5869,"playlist_index":260,"fulltitle":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","duration":"163"},{"format":"22 - 1280x720","description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.\n\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality.

He will re-create an intimate banquet, as the dessert course was known in 17th-century England, especially for the MIA's Tudor Room.\n\nVideo by Ryan Lee\n\nMusic: \"Handel - Entrance to the Queen of Sheba for Two Oboes, Strings, and Continuo allegro\" (by Advent Chamber Orchestra) www.freemusicarchive.org","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/qebdv6yH2B8/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"qebdv6yH2B8","title":"Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting","upload_date":"20121217","extractor":"youtube","like_count":18,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting","url":"https://r5---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&expire=1395184446&id=a9e6ddbfac87d81f&requiressl=yes&signature=7581CD12E21119289695C7C4767FAFEA9F1170FA.756108825F3CC74C3C6DF631306984B8BECF5F69&ms=au&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&mv=m&upn=3cyWpF09k2c&source=youtube&itag=22&ipbits=0&mt=1395161810&ip=207.250.46.170&key=yt5&ratebypass=yes&sver=3","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qebdv6yH2B8","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"22","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":2579,"playlist_index":69,"fulltitle":"Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting","duration":"275"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Phase 4: Write an Artist's Statement—With their ofrendas near completion, students write narratives about their ofrendas, which are used as the label texts for the exhibition, printed in both Spanish and English.\n\nLearn more about the Young People's Ofrenda Project at the MIA at http://www.artsmia.org/ofrenda","thumbnail":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/E5_jU74RE74/hqdefault.jpg","age_limit":0,"annotations":null,"dislike_count":0,"id":"E5_jU74RE74","title":"Tabatha - Young People's Ofrenda 2011 - Phase Four","upload_date":"20111101","extractor":"youtube","like_count":0,"subtitles":null,"stitle":"Tabatha - Young People's Ofrenda 2011 - Phase Four","url":"https://r8---sn-ufuxaxjvh-q4fe.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=18&ip=207.250.46.170&source=youtube&mv=m&expire=1395182948&ipbits=0&ratebypass=yes&requiressl=yes&sparams=id%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&id=o-AHwb1as0xOO65sbhKc55ReF0mhXopxj1dZF_hzvUDC8z&signature=49218893A7AE6930F4AF66E7519DA7D6974C2A3A.68CCA6832E5F91983F497D388F81CFD98E8F2C25&fexp=945000%2C914049%2C916623%2C937417%2C913434%2C936910%2C936913%2C934022&ms=au&upn=fVi2leMIMRw&sver=3&mt=1395161897&key=yt5","extractor_key":"Youtube","player_url":null,"ext":"mp4","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5_jU74RE74","file":"$file","uploader_id":"artsmia","format_id":"18","uploader":"artsmia","playlist":"artsmia","view_count":20,"playlist_index":173,"fulltitle":"Tabatha - Young People's Ofrenda 2011 - Phase Four","duration":"76"},{"format":"18 - 640x360","description":"Phase 3: Create a Personal Ofrenda—In this phase, students start to decorate their ofrendas, using materials they have collected during the first two weeks.

Each ofrenda reflects the student's own experience.\n\nThe project Web site and blog, of which this video is a part of, follows the progress of the students in creating their ofrendas. They relate their perspectives and insights as they honor their ancestors. Their final ofrendas and videos will be on view in an exhibition during the fall of 2010 at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\n\nWeek 1: Selection of Subject. Students explore ideas and concepts for their ofrendas. The subject can be personal, such as a tribute to a relative or friend.
