These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280,"slug":"new-pictures-4-angela-strassheim"},{"description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. Rutter is a recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative grant and is the publisher of Mystery Spot books.

In Analyst (Couch) (I), 2008, she shows the therapist's viewpoint: a banal-looking couch covered with a red blanket bears the imprint of the patient who lay upon it during a session. Arrangement (Analyst) (I), 2007, focuses on the objects that have been carefully arranged by the analyst to create a soothing environment for the patient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo large-scale diptychs—one showing a horse and the other a rose bush—refer to early stereographic prints and explore the potential for photography to reveal uncanny perspectives. In The Rose Gardens (display: III / white) (II) and (III), of 2008, Jones photographed a rose bush from both front and back so viewers can contemplate both viewpoints simultaneously.

Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history.

After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets.

Weil-Garris Brandt traces the elusive sources of Michelangelo’s genius, having explored his artistic origins while cracking the mystery of a curious artwork. For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.","duration":4576,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":480,"id":97536029,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/97536029","tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/477948619_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/477948619_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/477948619_100x75.jpg","title":"Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt | Michelangelos Genius Nature vs Nurture","upload_date":"2014-06-06 11:31:03","url":"http://vimeo.com/97536029","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":640,"slug":"kathleen-weil-garris-brandt-michelangelos-genius-nature-vs-nurture"},{"description":"On the second Sunday of every month, you’ll have a blast making art, going on artful adventures, meeting local musicians, dancers, and storytellers at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts!

Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.","duration":137,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":99355376,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/99355376","tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_100x75.jpg","title":"Monica Haller | Beneath the Ground","upload_date":"2014-06-27 13:12:13","url":"http://vimeo.com/99355376","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280,"slug":"monica-haller-beneath-the-ground"},{"description":"Marks of Genius: 100 Extraordinary Drawings is an exhibition that includes drawings, watercolors, gouaches, and pastels dating from the Middle Ages to the present day at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, particularly his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture illuminates how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/","duration":94,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":104750005,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/104750005","tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487379368_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487379368_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487379368_100x75.jpg","title":"James Holmberg: Forever","upload_date":"2014-08-29 15:48:36","url":"http://vimeo.com/104750005","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280,"slug":"james-holmberg-forever"},{"description":"Designed by teens for teens, Rated T @ MIA is a free social event focused on creative expression.

Géza von Habsburg will offer an “insider” view of the Habsburg royals, beginning with Emperor Maximilian I around 1500, the first to use family wealth and art to elevate the status of the House of Austria. Emperor Rudolph II (1552-1612), famed for his spendthrift ways and neglect of state affairs, was so obsessed with obtaining rare art objects that he literally lost the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia, and very nearly his title of Holy Roman Emperor. Yet, the glories of such extensive collections led to formation of today’s Kunstkammer in Vienna, from which the MIA will receive treasures for its next great exhibition, “The Habsburgs: Rarely Seen Masterpieces from Europe’s Greatest Dynasty.” Dr. von Habsburg brings us stories of these captivating royals and their exquisite objets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamed for his expertise on Fabergé, Dr. von Habsburg has written and curated extensively on this subject.

It focuses particularly on the three periods of their greatest flourishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first relates the history of the Habsburgs from the dynasty’s origins in the 13th century until the 16th century. The central figure is Maximilian I, during whose reign the Habsburgs achieved world-power status. You’ll see how an international network of political and family relations aided in the amassing of unique collections of art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevoted to the Age of the Baroque, the second block explores the art, culture, and politics of the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period the House of Habsburg dies out in both Spanish and Austrian male lines, provoking considerable political complications and the loss of Spain. A female heiress, Maria Theresa, succeeded in establishing her right to rule as heir to the Austrian line, becoming the final ruler of the House of Habsburg. Visitors will discover the role of religion, art, and court festivities as instruments propagating the dynasty’s self‐image and claim to rule. Key figures include Leopold Wilhelm, Leopold I, Charles VI, and Maria Theresa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early 19th century saw the final demise of the Holy Roman Empire and the establishment of the hereditary Austrian Empire. With the growth of nationalism, the empire would be transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria‐Hungary. Key figures of this period are Francis II (I) and Franz Joseph.

It focuses particularly on the three periods of their greatest flourishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first relates the history of the Habsburgs from the dynasty’s origins in the 13th century until the 16th century. The central figure is Maximilian I, during whose reign the Habsburgs achieved world-power status. You’ll see how an international network of political and family relations aided in the amassing of unique collections of art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevoted to the Age of the Baroque, the second block explores the art, culture, and politics of the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period the House of Habsburg dies out in both Spanish and Austrian male lines, provoking considerable political complications and the loss of Spain. A female heiress, Maria Theresa, succeeded in establishing her right to rule as heir to the Austrian line, becoming the final ruler of the House of Habsburg. Visitors will discover the role of religion, art, and court festivities as instruments propagating the dynasty’s self‐image and claim to rule. Key figures include Leopold Wilhelm, Leopold I, Charles VI, and Maria Theresa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early 19th century saw the final demise of the Holy Roman Empire and the establishment of the hereditary Austrian Empire. With the growth of nationalism, the empire would be transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria‐Hungary. Key figures of this period are Francis II (I) and Franz Joseph. This section explores the long reign of Emperor Franz Joseph, the founding of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and the creation of the multinational empire. This empire, characterized by a highly hierarchical social order, is represented by the lavish gowns of the imperial court.

Géza von Habsburg will offer an “insider” view of the Habsburg royals, beginning with Emperor Maximilian I around 1500, the first to use family wealth and art to elevate the status of the House of Austria. Emperor Rudolph II (1552-1612), famed for his spendthrift ways and neglect of state affairs, was so obsessed with obtaining rare art objects that he literally lost the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia, and very nearly his title of Holy Roman Emperor. Yet, the glories of such extensive collections led to formation of today’s Kunstkammer in Vienna, from which the MIA will receive treasures for its next great exhibition, “The Habsburgs: Rarely Seen Masterpieces from Europe’s Greatest Dynasty.” Dr. von Habsburg brings us stories of these captivating royals and their exquisite objets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamed for his expertise on Fabergé, Dr. von Habsburg has written and curated extensively on this subject. He was Chairman of Christie’s in Europe for 18 years, specializing in Old Master paintings and the applied arts. He has taught at the New York School of Interior Design, at the Bard Graduate Center for the Decorative Art, at New York University, and lectures worldwide. He is currently a visiting professor at Okinawa University in Japan and serves on the vetting committees of numerous international art fairs. Dr. von Habsburg is the great, great grandson of Emperor Franz-Joseph of Austria and grandson of King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony.","duration":5105,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":540,"id":116486856,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/116486856","tags":"Géza von Habsburg, Vienna Kunstkammer","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/502951936_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/502951936_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/502951936_100x75.jpg","title":"Géza von Habsburg- “Great Habsburg Collectors: The Birth of the Vienna Kunstkammer”","upload_date":"2015-01-11 14:44:42","url":"http://vimeo.com/116486856","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":720,"slug":"géza-von-habsburg-great-habsburg-collectors-the-birth-of-the-vienna-kunstkammer"},{"description":"As one of the first women photographers to work for National Geographic, Annie Griffiths is known for her ability to capture inspiring human moments through photographs from nearly 150 countries.

One of Cave’s recent goals has been to nudge viewers from their work-a-day lethargy, lifting them to a place where they are free to dream again.","duration":4092,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":464,"id":97370568,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/97370568","tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/477823028_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/477823028_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/477823028_100x75.jpg","title":"Nick Cave | Body Of Work","upload_date":"2014-06-04 17:00:21","url":"http://vimeo.com/97370568","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":640,"slug":"nick-cave-body-of-work"}]},{"created_on":"2014-04-16 11:24:07","description":"","id":2830866,"last_modified":"2014-05-05 16:53:07","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/471665027_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/471665027_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/471665027_100x75.jpg","title":"Recent Acquisitions","total_videos":3,"url":"http://vimeo.com/album/2830866","slug":"recent-acquisitions","videos":[{"description":"Gift from the John R.

Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/event/beneath-the-ground/<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/the-nature-of-nature/beneath-the-ground/","duration":137,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":99355376,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/99355376","tags":"exhibition:Beneath the Ground, exhibition:The Nature of Nature, Gallery:277","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/480506089_100x75.jpg","title":"Monica Haller | Beneath the Ground","upload_date":"2014-06-27 13:12:13","url":"http://vimeo.com/99355376","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280,"slug":"monica-haller-beneath-the-ground"},{"description":"Mark Dion is an American artist best known for his seductive and often fantastical cabinets of curiosity.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. Rutter is a recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative grant and is the publisher of Mystery Spot books.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing.

In Analyst (Couch) (I), 2008, she shows the therapist's viewpoint: a banal-looking couch covered with a red blanket bears the imprint of the patient who lay upon it during a session. Arrangement (Analyst) (I), 2007, focuses on the objects that have been carefully arranged by the analyst to create a soothing environment for the patient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo large-scale diptychs—one showing a horse and the other a rose bush—refer to early stereographic prints and explore the potential for photography to reveal uncanny perspectives.

Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets.

The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280,"slug":"new-pictures-4-angela-strassheim"},{"description":"The third exhibition in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' new photography series presents the innovative work of Los Angeles photographer James Welling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"New Pictures 3: James Welling, Glass House\" showcases an elegant photographic series of Philip Johnson's modernist architectural masterpiece, Glass House (1949).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a digital camera and color filters, Welling experiments with new possibilities for architectural photography, capturing the luminous effects of Johnson's glass-skinned structure at different times and with changing light conditions over a three-year period (2006--2008.)

At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.
