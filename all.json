The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","thumbnail_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155716_100.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155716_200.jpg","thumbnail_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155716_640.jpg","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","user_portrait_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_30.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_75.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_100.jpg","user_portrait_huge":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_300.jpg","stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":0,"stats_number_of_comments":0,"duration":162,"width":1280,"height":720,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":90134384,"title":"New Pictures 3: James Welling","description":"The third exhibition in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' new photography series presents the innovative work of Los Angeles photographer James Welling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"New Pictures 3: James Welling, Glass House\" showcases an elegant photographic series of Philip Johnson's modernist architectural masterpiece, Glass House (1949).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a digital camera and color filters, Welling experiments with new possibilities for architectural photography, capturing the luminous effects of Johnson's glass-skinned structure at different times and with changing light conditions over a three-year period (2006--2008.)

By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.

By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.

These early works spoke to the role of the photographer in staging the vision and narrative of each picture. Welling's work has been exhibited internationally and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition, \"James Welling Photographs, 1974--1999.\"","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134384","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134384","thumbnail_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155427_100.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155427_200.jpg","thumbnail_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155427_640.jpg","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","user_portrait_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_30.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_75.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_100.jpg","user_portrait_huge":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_300.jpg","stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":1,"stats_number_of_comments":0,"duration":259,"width":1280,"height":720,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":90134386,"title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","description":"The fourth edition of \"New Pictures,\" a semi-annual series dedicated to showcasing vital experiments in photography and new media by artists from around the world, features a selection of photographs by Angela Strassheim from her series Evidence. These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","thumbnail_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155716_100.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155716_200.jpg","thumbnail_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/155/469155716_640.jpg","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","user_portrait_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_30.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_75.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_100.jpg","user_portrait_huge":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_300.jpg","stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":0,"stats_number_of_comments":0,"duration":162,"width":1280,"height":720,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":90134389,"title":"New Pictures 5: Jason Fulford","description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in magazines and books.","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134389","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:35","mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134389","thumbnail_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/156/469156337_100.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/156/469156337_200.jpg","thumbnail_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/469/156/469156337_640.jpg","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","user_portrait_small":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_30.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_75.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_100.jpg","user_portrait_huge":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/714/939/7149390_300.jpg","stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":0,"stats_number_of_comments":0,"duration":153,"width":1280,"height":720,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":90134391,"title":"New Pictures 6: Martin Parr","description":"Friday, April 20, 2012—Sunday, August 5, 2012<br />\r\nLinda and Lawrence Perlman Gallery (262)<br />\r\nFree Exhibition<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs part of our \"New Pictures\" series devoted to innovation in contemporary photography, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts invited British photographer Martin Parr to cross the pond and shoot photos covering the wealth of winter activities in Minnesota, from pond hockey to ice fishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe results of his endeavor are on view in his exhibition, \"New Pictures 6: Martin Parr,\" opening April 20 in the Linda and Lawrence Perlman Gallery (262).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member of the esteemed Magnum Photos, an international photographers' cooperative, Parr is one of the most renowned and celebrated photographers working today.
