Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. Rutter is a recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative grant and is the publisher of Mystery Spot books.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

Presented each fall and spring, New Pictures highlights the vital experimentations in photography and new media undertaken by artists who grapple with making images that address today's culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreuer's works invite close inspection of their complex and delicate surfaces, colors, and forms. At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":1,"stats_number_of_plays":63,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles.
