{"videos":[{"description":"In this exhibition, simply titled \"Sacred,\" curators have assembled art from every corner of the world. Although these works span time, distance, and disparate cultures, they share an evolving sense of the sacred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the ten galleries in the exhibition features an installation or \"mini-show\" designed around different themes or narratives inspired by the word \"sacred.\" Conventionally used to describe something or someone imbued with divinity, the word has evolved as societies have become more diverse and secular. What's sacred today? The word hinges on the speaker: what is sacred is often very personal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the objects in these galleries were never intended for display in a museum. Taken out of their usual contexts, they ask to be seen differently, posing provocative questions about what is sacred. How does their presence here change our perception of them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these juxtapositions, you can explore historical and contemporary expressions of the divine, the spiritual, the essential, and the beloved while reflecting on the meaning of the word \"sacred.\" What does it mean to you?","duration":134,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":93167313,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/93167313","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":6,"tags":"museum, art, exhibition, minneapolis","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/473142664_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/473142664_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/473142664_100x75.jpg","title":"The Sacred -- Exhibition at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts","upload_date":"2014-04-28 13:09:26","url":"http://vimeo.com/93167313","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Marla Spivak of the University of Minnesota BeeSquad talks about the importance of having bees on the roof of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts","duration":120,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":93166314,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/93166314","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":5,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/473141728_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/473141728_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/473141728_100x75.jpg","title":"Beekeeping at Minneapolis Institute of Arts","upload_date":"2014-04-28 13:00:05","url":"http://vimeo.com/93166314","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Creativity Academy is an educational program at the MIA.

The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in magazines and books.","duration":153,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134389,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134389","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":21,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469156337_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469156337_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469156337_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 5: Jason Fulford","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:35","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134389","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"The fourth edition of \"New Pictures,\" a semi-annual series dedicated to showcasing vital experiments in photography and new media by artists from around the world, features a selection of photographs by Angela Strassheim from her series Evidence. These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":1,"stats_number_of_plays":58,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"The third exhibition in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' new photography series presents the innovative work of Los Angeles photographer James Welling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"New Pictures 3: James Welling, Glass House\" showcases an elegant photographic series of Philip Johnson's modernist architectural masterpiece, Glass House (1949).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a digital camera and color filters, Welling experiments with new possibilities for architectural photography, capturing the luminous effects of Johnson's glass-skinned structure at different times and with changing light conditions over a three-year period (2006--2008.)

Presented each fall and spring, New Pictures highlights the vital experimentations in photography and new media undertaken by artists who grapple with making images that address today's culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreuer's works invite close inspection of their complex and delicate surfaces, colors, and forms. At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12. At that time, the artist will alter the space to evoke a darkroom and will create a site-specific installation addressing the relationship between photography and drawing.","duration":87,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134383,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134383","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":50,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469154005_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469154005_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469154005_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:33","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134383","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Rinko Kawauchi's first museum exhibition in the United States shows why she's one of the most important and popular female photographers working in Japan today.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":1,"stats_number_of_plays":58,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"The third exhibition in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' new photography series presents the innovative work of Los Angeles photographer James Welling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"New Pictures 3: James Welling, Glass House\" showcases an elegant photographic series of Philip Johnson's modernist architectural masterpiece, Glass House (1949).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a digital camera and color filters, Welling experiments with new possibilities for architectural photography, capturing the luminous effects of Johnson's glass-skinned structure at different times and with changing light conditions over a three-year period (2006--2008.)

His experimental use of color and light to explore spatiality makes him a particularly important artist to feature in the MIA's 'New Pictures' series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelling, a professor in the Department of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles, first gained national recognition in the 1970s and 1980s for his carefully staged black-and-white photographs employing such unconventional mediums as pastry dough, gelatin, and tinfoil. These early works spoke to the role of the photographer in staging the vision and narrative of each picture. Welling's work has been exhibited internationally and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition, \"James Welling Photographs, 1974--1999.\"","duration":259,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134384,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134384","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":42,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155427_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155427_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155427_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 3: James Welling","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134384","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Abstract photographs by the German artist Marco Breuer (b. 1966) are featured in this \"New Pictures\" exhibition, the second in a semiannual series dedicated to innovative new work by artists from around the world.

At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12. At that time, the artist will alter the space to evoke a darkroom and will create a site-specific installation addressing the relationship between photography and drawing.","duration":87,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134383,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134383","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":50,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469154005_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469154005_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469154005_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:33","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134383","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"Noriko Furunishi's monumental landscape photographs inaugurate New Pictures, a semiannual series dedicated to innovative work by emerging artists from around the world.

After selecting four to six images, Furunishi scans the negatives onto a computer and then digitally stitches them together with Adobe Photoshop to create seemingly continuous landscapes.

At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12.

These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.","duration":162,"embed_privacy":"anywhere","height":720,"id":90134386,"mobile_url":"http://vimeo.com/m/90134386","stats_number_of_comments":0,"stats_number_of_likes":1,"stats_number_of_plays":58,"tags":"","thumbnail_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_640.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_200x150.jpg","thumbnail_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/469155716_100x75.jpg","title":"New Pictures 4: Angela Strassheim","upload_date":"2014-03-26 12:11:34","url":"http://vimeo.com/90134386","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_portrait_huge":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_300x300.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_100x100.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_75x75.jpg","user_portrait_small":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/7149390_30x30.jpg","user_url":"http://vimeo.com/artsmia","width":1280},{"description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles.
