    "description": "Noriko Furunishi's monumental landscape photographs inaugurate New Pictures, a semiannual series dedicated to innovative work by emerging artists from around the world. Presented each fall and spring, the series highlights the vital experimentations in photography and new media undertaken by artists who grapple with making images that address today's culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurunishi, who was born in Kobe, Japan, and lives in Los Angeles, uses a large-format 4 x 5 camera to make several film images of geographical sites in the United States. Each image represents a different point of view, typically including one with a span from the tip of the artists toes into the foreground and landscape. After selecting four to six images, Furunishi scans the negatives onto a computer and then digitally stitches them together with Adobe Photoshop to create seemingly continuous landscapes. A close look reveals that some images have been flipped upside down or rearranged within the composition. The vertical orientation of Furunishi's photographs recalls the complex formal compositions of historical Chinese and Japanese hanging scroll paintings, providing a contemporary perspective on the MIA's renowned Asian collection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurunishi's photographs suggest the new visual conditions and technological possibilities of our own time through their subtly warped vistas, which upend preconceptions about the land beneath our feet and the skies overhead.",

    "description": "Abstract photographs by the German artist Marco Breuer (b. 1966) are featured in this \"New Pictures\" exhibition, the second in a semiannual series dedicated to innovative new work by artists from around the world. Presented each fall and spring, New Pictures highlights the vital experimentations in photography and new media undertaken by artists who grapple with making images that address today's culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreuer's works invite close inspection of their complex and delicate surfaces, colors, and forms. At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12. At that time, the artist will alter the space to evoke a darkroom and will create a site-specific installation addressing the relationship between photography and drawing.",

    "description": "The third exhibition in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' new photography series presents the innovative work of Los Angeles photographer James Welling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"New Pictures 3: James Welling, Glass House\" showcases an elegant photographic series of Philip Johnson's modernist architectural masterpiece, Glass House (1949).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a digital camera and color filters, Welling experiments with new possibilities for architectural photography, capturing the luminous effects of Johnson's glass-skinned structure at different times and with changing light conditions over a three-year period (2006--2008.) These atmospheric works reveal the ambiguity between the interior built space and exterior natural space evoked by Johnson's home. These pictures suggest a physical experience of space and form that is unique in architectural photography.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJames Welling has been producing groundbreaking work since the 1970s that possesses a rare combination of conceptual depth and technical skill. Through the last three decades, he continues to challenge himself as a photographer and offers viewers new discoveries through thoughtful and visually arresting photographs that suggest overlooked aspects of the medium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the last five years, he has taken on the challenge of architecture and produced a body of work that offers a new take on representations of architecture within a natural site. His experimental use of color and light to explore spatiality makes him a particularly important artist to feature in the MIA's 'New Pictures' series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelling, a professor in the Department of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles, first gained national recognition in the 1970s and 1980s for his carefully staged black-and-white photographs employing such unconventional mediums as pastry dough, gelatin, and tinfoil. These early works spoke to the role of the photographer in staging the vision and narrative of each picture. Welling's work has been exhibited internationally and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition, \"James Welling Photographs, 1974--1999.\"",

    "description": "The fourth edition of \"New Pictures,\" a semi-annual series dedicated to showcasing vital experiments in photography and new media by artists from around the world, features a selection of photographs by Angela Strassheim from her series Evidence. These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.",

    "description": "A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in magazines and books.",
