    "description": "Pao Her’s exhibition of new photographs, Attention, focuses on the importance of military service to Hmong-American identity. In the 1960s, the CIA enlisted Hmong and Laotian soldiers to fight a secret war alongside the conflict in Vietnam, soldiers the United States still does not recognize as U.S. veterans despite their sacrifices on behalf of the U.S.. The men that Her has photographed, in the tradition of classical paintings of generals, are veterans of that war—excluded from subsidized health services, refused the right to be buried in national cemeteries, and disqualified from wearing U.S.–sanctioned military uniforms and medals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore info: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/pao-her-and-shana-kaplow/",

    "description": "While words and images keep us connected to friends and family across the world, Shana Kaplow’s “Near and Far” is inspired by the connectivity shared through the objects we use most. Her paintings of tables and chairs feature common items that fill many homes, yet focus on the effects of mass production and the global reach of a domestic commodity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe also uses video to find connections between cultures, labor and domestic architecture. Gravity, a video projected onto a dining room table, is a deceptively simple reversal of dripped liquid ink that elegantly transition from deepest black to blank white. By using both abstraction and photo realism, Kaplow stresses the tension of connecting with the unfamiliar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShana Kaplow is a fiscal year 2014 recipient of an Artist Initiative Grant from the MN State Arts Board. This activity is made possible by the voters of MN through a grant form the Minnesota State Arts Board, thanks to a legislative appropriation from the arts and cultural heritage fund.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore info at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/pao-her-and-shana-kaplow/",

    "description": "Jonathan Kaiser’s “Inverse Echo” is an engaging sonic experience, a sculptural sound installation featuring a quartet of custom-made vinyl records on continuous repeat. Kaiser is interested in the tension between circular and linear conceptions of time, using looped records to explore the interconnection between past, present, and future. By varying the playback speed of the different records, he creates a perpetually shifting four-channel composition, evolving even as it repeats. The sculptural and spatial elements of the installation address related themes of symmetry and repetition. Kaiser is an internationally recognized musician and his one-person exhibition, “Blind Arcade,” was recently presented at the Rochester Art Center.<br />\n<br />\nJonathan Kaiser and Carolyn Swiszcz, January 15 - March 29, 2015<br />\n<br />\nMore information at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

The themes of life and death, both real and virtual, are repeated throughout his work, as seen in his use of traditional memento mori, such as funerary reliefs and vanitas paintings. It may appear that the bricks and hero’s face in “When You’re Dead, You’re Dead” are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously hand painted.

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

He creates fascinating sculptural installations that re-present digital and analog images and \"utilize photography as a technical and philosophical strategy.\" Most recently, he has been interested in ocular phenomena such as the persistence of vision, linear perspective, and the stereoscopic illusion. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition: Jaron Childs and Jonathan Bruce Williams Exhibition Dates: January 17 - March 30, 2014<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/jar...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) is a curatorial program of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) dedicated to exhibiting and supporting artists living and working in the state of Minnesota. <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

    "description": "Jaron Childs' exhibition presents a new series of hyper-realistic and finely detailed paintings, based on his own photographs, that are a rejoinder to contemporary attitudes about beauty in painting. He has done this by carefully choosing images that both test the limits of acceptable sentimentality for critical art and offer visual pleasures that also contain sensations of alienation and loss. With a relatively small number of works, \"How to make a world\" is meant to engage the various and contradicting claims made on painting regarding beauty, artistic merit, and its relevance as a medium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition: Jaron Childs and Jonathan Bruce Williams Exhibition Dates: January 17 - March 30, 2014<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/jar...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) is a curatorial program of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) dedicated to exhibiting and supporting artists living and working in the state of Minnesota. <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",
