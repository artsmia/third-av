    "description": "The driving principle of Williams's MAEP exhibition is to display the science and technology of vision. He creates fascinating sculptural installations that re-present digital and analog images and \"utilize photography as a technical and philosophical strategy.\" Most recently, he has been interested in ocular phenomena such as the persistence of vision, linear perspective, and the stereoscopic illusion. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition: Jaron Childs and Jonathan Bruce Williams Exhibition Dates: January 17 - March 30, 2014<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/jar...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) is a curatorial program of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) dedicated to exhibiting and supporting artists living and working in the state of Minnesota. <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

    "description": "Jaron Childs' exhibition presents a new series of hyper-realistic and finely detailed paintings, based on his own photographs, that are a rejoinder to contemporary attitudes about beauty in painting. He has done this by carefully choosing images that both test the limits of acceptable sentimentality for critical art and offer visual pleasures that also contain sensations of alienation and loss. With a relatively small number of works, \"How to make a world\" is meant to engage the various and contradicting claims made on painting regarding beauty, artistic merit, and its relevance as a medium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition: Jaron Childs and Jonathan Bruce Williams Exhibition Dates: January 17 - March 30, 2014<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/jar...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) is a curatorial program of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) dedicated to exhibiting and supporting artists living and working in the state of Minnesota. <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",
