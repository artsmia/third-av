    "description": "What's beneath our feetâ€”and the museum? Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/event/beneath-the-ground/<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/the-nature-of-nature/beneath-the-ground/",

    "description": "Mark Dion is an American artist best known for his seductive and often fantastical cabinets of curiosity. Based on 17th-century Wunderkammern (\"chambers of wonder\"), his work explores the relationships among art, science, and history through pseudo-scientific methods of investigation and display. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis new installation, Curator's Office, commissioned for the exhibition \"More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness,\" claims the artist rediscovered an office used in the 1950s by the first curator of modern art at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Within the context of a museum exhibition, however, Curator's Office also becomes a \"period room,\" an installation of objects, furnishings, and architecture meant to illustrate a historical moment by re-creating its interior domestic spaces. Period rooms are popular museum attractions that are both authentic (in their contents) and false (in their detachment from their original contexts.)",
