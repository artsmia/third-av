[{"id":87685777,"title":"MIA Artist in Residence: Mark Dion","description":"Mark Dion is an American artist best known for his seductive and often fantastical cabinets of curiosity. Based on 17th-century Wunderkammern (\"chambers of wonder\"), his work explores the relationships among art, science, and history through pseudo-scientific methods of investigation and display. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHis new installation, Curator's Office, commissioned for the exhibition \"More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness,\" claims the artist rediscovered an office used in the 1950s by the first curator of modern art at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Within the context of a museum exhibition, however, Curator's Office also becomes a \"period room,\" an installation of objects, furnishings, and architecture meant to illustrate a historical moment by re-creating its interior domestic spaces. Period rooms are popular museum attractions that are both authentic (in their contents) and false (in their detachment from their original contexts.)","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/87685777","upload_date":"2014-02-26 12:10:36","mobile_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/m\/87685777","thumbnail_small":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/465\/842\/465842316_100.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/465\/842\/465842316_200.jpg","thumbnail_large":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/465\/842\/465842316_640.jpg","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/artsmia","user_portrait_small":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_30.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_75.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_100.jpg","user_portrait_huge":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_300.jpg","stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":7,"stats_number_of_comments":0,"duration":131,"width":1280,"height":720,"tags":"mia:object=116294, mia:exhibition=more-real","embed_privacy":"anywhere"}]
