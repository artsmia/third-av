    "description": "What's beneath our feet—and the museum? Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/event/beneath-the-ground/<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/the-nature-of-nature/beneath-the-ground/",

    "description": "In this exhibition, simply titled \"Sacred,\" curators have assembled art from every corner of the world. Although these works span time, distance, and disparate cultures, they share an evolving sense of the sacred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the ten galleries in the exhibition features an installation or \"mini-show\" designed around different themes or narratives inspired by the word \"sacred.\" Conventionally used to describe something or someone imbued with divinity, the word has evolved as societies have become more diverse and secular. What's sacred today? The word hinges on the speaker: what is sacred is often very personal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the objects in these galleries were never intended for display in a museum. Taken out of their usual contexts, they ask to be seen differently, posing provocative questions about what is sacred. How does their presence here change our perception of them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these juxtapositions, you can explore historical and contemporary expressions of the divine, the spiritual, the essential, and the beloved while reflecting on the meaning of the word \"sacred.\" What does it mean to you?",

Kawauchi's unique installation of photographs at the MIA capture ordinary, fleeting moments of light and daily life, the photographs evoking everything from wonderment to the grotesque. A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition Dates: February 20 - August 10, 2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFind more information at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/new-pictures-9-rinko-kawauchi/",
