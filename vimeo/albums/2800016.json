[{"id":90059652,"title":"New Pictures 9: Rinko Kawauchi","description":"Rinko Kawauchi's first museum exhibition in the United States shows why she's one of the most important and popular female photographers working in Japan today. Kawauchi's unique installation of photographs at the MIA capture ordinary, fleeting moments of light and daily life, the photographs evoking everything from wonderment to the grotesque. A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nExhibition Dates: February 20 - August 10, 2014","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/90059652","upload_date":"2014-03-25 16:37:53","mobile_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/m\/90059652","thumbnail_small":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/469\/047\/469047957_100.jpg","thumbnail_medium":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/469\/047\/469047957_200.jpg","thumbnail_large":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ts\/469\/047\/469047957_640.jpg","user_id":24860937,"user_name":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","user_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/artsmia","user_portrait_small":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_30.jpg","user_portrait_medium":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_75.jpg","user_portrait_large":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_100.jpg","user_portrait_huge":"http:\/\/b.vimeocdn.com\/ps\/714\/939\/7149390_300.jpg","stats_number_of_likes":0,"stats_number_of_plays":5,"stats_number_of_comments":0,"duration":114,"width":1280,"height":720,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":87681978,"title":"31 Years: Gifts from Martin Weinstein","description":"Exhibition Dates: November 2, 2013 - August 31, 2014<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMartin Weinstein, a former trial attorney turned photography connoisseur, has given more than 500 photographs to the MIA, in addition to numerous prints, paintings, and sculptures. \"31 Years: Gifts from Martin Weinstein\" celebrates the depth and quality of his decades of art giving.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe photographs on view include a who's who in the history of photography, from Margaret Bourke-White and Ansel Adams to Robert Mapplethorpe and Alec Soth.
