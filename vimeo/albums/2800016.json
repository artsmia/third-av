    "description": "In this exhibition, simply titled \"Sacred,\" curators have assembled art from every corner of the world. Although these works span time, distance, and disparate cultures, they share an evolving sense of the sacred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the ten galleries in the exhibition features an installation or \"mini-show\" designed around different themes or narratives inspired by the word \"sacred.\" Conventionally used to describe something or someone imbued with divinity, the word has evolved as societies have become more diverse and secular. What's sacred today? The word hinges on the speaker: what is sacred is often very personal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the objects in these galleries were never intended for display in a museum. Taken out of their usual contexts, they ask to be seen differently, posing provocative questions about what is sacred. How does their presence here change our perception of them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these juxtapositions, you can explore historical and contemporary expressions of the divine, the spiritual, the essential, and the beloved while reflecting on the meaning of the word \"sacred.\" What does it mean to you?",

    "description": "Rinko Kawauchi's first museum exhibition in the United States shows why she's one of the most important and popular female photographers working in Japan today. Kawauchi's unique installation of photographs at the MIA capture ordinary, fleeting moments of light and daily life, the photographs evoking everything from wonderment to the grotesque. A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition Dates: February 20 - August 10, 2014",
