    "description": "Rinko Kawauchi's first museum exhibition in the United States shows why she's one of the most important and popular female photographers working in Japan today. Kawauchi's unique installation of photographs at the MIA capture ordinary, fleeting moments of light and daily life, the photographs evoking everything from wonderment to the grotesque. A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExhibition Dates: February 20 - August 10, 2014",
