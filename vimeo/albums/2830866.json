    "description": "Yes, this is contemporary Native American art! Yellow gold, brilliant cut diamonds, silk knotted pearl strings with indigenous wampum, and fresh water pearls surround miniature portraits of Pocahontas (1596-1617). Working collaboratively to bring fellow Native American woman Pocahontas to life, artists Jamie Okuma and Keri Ataumbi found inspiration in historical depictions of this iconic figure; the 1616 engraving by Simon Van De Passe and the classic 1852 painting by Thomas Sully. In the style of 16th century Jacobean portraiture, Okuma depicts Pocahontas using beads on buckskin as her canvas, and Ataumbi uses precious metals and stones to frame to frame the piece. Take a peek at the back of the ring—it too has a portrait! Ataumbi and Okuma create a work of art that reflects upon classical representations of Pocahontas and then fashion new portraits of her in unexpected ways. Adornment: Iconic Perceptions invites us to think about the way we view Native American history and art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttps://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=120378",

    "description": "In 1879, James McNeill Whistler was down on his luck. A gallery owner rescued him with a commission to go to Venice to produce a dozen etchings. There, watery reflections of ancient architecture and atmospheric light provided endless inspiration suited to the artist’s loose treatment of form. He fell in love with the city and stayed for more than a year, producing over fifty etchings plus many other works of art. Nocturne: Palaces is among the most poetic of his Venetian creations. This is an exceptionally early proof, taken after his first retouching of the plate with his drypoint needle. He printed it himself. Leaving a carefully modulated veil of ink on the surface of the copper printing plate and printing it on antique paper, he produced magically luminous effects of light. Whistler called the image a nocturne to emphasize his intention to produce “an artistic arrangement” rather than a topographical depiction. Indeed, scholars have been unable to locate the place of this view, which may have existed primarily in Whistler’s imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttps://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=120316",
