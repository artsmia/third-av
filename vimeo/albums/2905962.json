    "description": "How do you complete the building of a cathedral started nearly 100 years before by an eccentric but brilliant architect who left no written plans and whose plaster models were destroyed by Spanish anarchists? Here’s your chance to ask the architect faced with that challenge.<br />\n<br />\nFor over three decades, Australian architect Mark Burry has devoted his career to untangling the mysteries left in Antoni Gaudi’s masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which was less than one-quarter done when he died in 1926. There were “secrets” in Gaudi’s design, the basilica’s two octogenarian architects told Burry in 1977 when he started. Every aspect of Gaudi’s complex design took shape in his head. But it has taken software designed for the aerospace industry to bring his innovations in acoustics, structure, color, and light to fruition. Burry will describe the cultural enrichment that comes from such a transcendent project.",

    "description": "In 1914, Europe was on the brink of committing suicide. This talk by longtime New Yorker writer, art critic, and book author Adam Gopnik examines the ways in which the modernist movement—at its apogee of innovation in literature, visual arts, and music—was reshaped and destroyed by The Great War. Gopnik will investigate how the catastrophic collision of European powers ripped apart the early twentieth-century’s optimistic cultural life and progressive civilization in ways that only began to be reconstituted and restored in our own time, 100 years later.",

    "description": "Beautiful, rare, costly, and odd. For 600 years, the aristocratic Habsburg dynasty that ruled much of Europe amassed an unrivaled collection of art and antiquities   that reflected the family’s wealth and power. Jumbles of rock crystal, ivory, bronze, armament, coins, books, paintings, even animals, plants, and minerals from around the world initially were displayed in Kunstkammers— cabinets of art and wonders. How did these antique versions of massive China cabinets morph into the modern museum?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSabine Haag, PhD, director of Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum, will enchant us with stories of Habsburg emperors, queens, and their emissaries, and will reveal how their collecting obsessions grew into the world-renowned Kunstkammer Vienna that delights us today.",

    "description": "Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt traces the elusive sources of Michelangelo’s genius, having explored his artistic origins while cracking the mystery of a curious artwork. For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.",
