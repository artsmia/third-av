    "description": "Who better than an internationally renowned Habsburg to speak about the eccentricities and collecting fervor of the dynasty that ruled Europe for over 600 years? Géza von Habsburg will offer an “insider” view of the Habsburg royals, beginning with Emperor Maximilian I around 1500, the first to use family wealth and art to elevate the status of the House of Austria. Emperor Rudolph II (1552-1612), famed for his spendthrift ways and neglect of state affairs, was so obsessed with obtaining rare art objects that he literally lost the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia, and very nearly his title of Holy Roman Emperor. Yet, the glories of such extensive collections led to formation of today’s Kunstkammer in Vienna, from which the MIA will receive treasures for its next great exhibition, “The Habsburgs: Rarely Seen Masterpieces from Europe’s Greatest Dynasty.” Dr. von Habsburg brings us stories of these captivating royals and their exquisite objets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamed for his expertise on Fabergé, Dr. von Habsburg has written and curated extensively on this subject. He was Chairman of Christie’s in Europe for 18 years, specializing in Old Master paintings and the applied arts. He has taught at the New York School of Interior Design, at the Bard Graduate Center for the Decorative Art, at New York University, and lectures worldwide. He is currently a visiting professor at Okinawa University in Japan and serves on the vetting committees of numerous international art fairs. Dr. von Habsburg is the great, great grandson of Emperor Franz-Joseph of Austria and grandson of King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony.",

Here’s your chance to ask the architect faced with that challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor over three decades, Australian architect Mark Burry has devoted his career to untangling the mysteries left in Antoni Gaudi’s masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which was less than one-quarter done when he died in 1926. There were “secrets” in Gaudi’s design, the basilica’s two octogenarian architects told Burry in 1977 when he started. Every aspect of Gaudi’s complex design took shape in his head. But it has taken software designed for the aerospace industry to bring his innovations in acoustics, structure, color, and light to fruition. Burry will describe the cultural enrichment that comes from such a transcendent project.",

This talk by longtime New Yorker writer, art critic, and book author Adam Gopnik examines the ways in which the modernist movement—at its apogee of innovation in literature, visual arts, and music—was reshaped and destroyed by The Great War. Gopnik will investigate how the catastrophic collision of European powers ripped apart the early twentieth-century’s optimistic cultural life and progressive civilization in ways that only began to be reconstituted and restored in our own time, 100 years later.",

For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.",

    "description": "Visual artist Nick Cave is a poet of sight, sound, motion and emotion, known for his larger-than-life “soundsuits,” mesmerizing hybrids of art and dance, made from scavenged and cast-off materials.  Since completing the MIA’s “Soundsuit” in 2010, Cave has achieved international prominence. One of Cave’s recent goals has been to nudge viewers from their work-a-day lethargy, lifting them to a place where they are free to dream again.",
