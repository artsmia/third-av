    "description": "While words and images keep us connected to friends and family across the world, Shana Kaplow’s “Near and Far” is inspired by the connectivity shared through the objects we use most. Her paintings of tables and chairs feature common items that fill many homes, yet focus on the effects of mass production and the global reach of a domestic commodity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe also uses video to find connections between cultures, labor and domestic architecture. Gravity, a video projected onto a dining room table, is a deceptively simple reversal of dripped liquid ink that elegantly transition from deepest black to blank white. By using both abstraction and photo realism, Kaplow stresses the tension of connecting with the unfamiliar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShana Kaplow is a fiscal year 2014 recipient of an Artist Initiative Grant from the MN State Arts Board. This activity is made possible by the voters of MN through a grant form the Minnesota State Arts Board, thanks to a legislative appropriation from the arts and cultural heritage fund.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore info at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/pao-her-and-shana-kaplow/",

    "description": "In 1879, James McNeill Whistler was down on his luck. A gallery owner rescued him with a commission to go to Venice to produce a dozen etchings. There, watery reflections of ancient architecture and atmospheric light provided endless inspiration suited to the artist’s loose treatment of form. He fell in love with the city and stayed for more than a year, producing over fifty etchings plus many other works of art. Nocturne: Palaces is among the most poetic of his Venetian creations. This is an exceptionally early proof, taken after his first retouching of the plate with his drypoint needle. He printed it himself. Leaving a carefully modulated veil of ink on the surface of the copper printing plate and printing it on antique paper, he produced magically luminous effects of light. Whistler called the image a nocturne to emphasize his intention to produce “an artistic arrangement” rather than a topographical depiction. Indeed, scholars have been unable to locate the place of this view, which may have existed primarily in Whistler’s imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttps://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=120316",

    "description": "Yes, this is contemporary Native American art! Yellow gold, brilliant cut diamonds, silk knotted pearl strings with indigenous wampum, and fresh water pearls surround miniature portraits of Pocahontas (1596-1617). Working collaboratively to bring fellow Native American woman Pocahontas to life, artists Jamie Okuma and Keri Ataumbi found inspiration in historical depictions of this iconic figure; the 1616 engraving by Simon Van De Passe and the classic 1852 painting by Thomas Sully. In the style of 16th century Jacobean portraiture, Okuma depicts Pocahontas using beads on buckskin as her canvas, and Ataumbi uses precious metals and stones to frame to frame the piece. Take a peek at the back of the ring—it too has a portrait! Ataumbi and Okuma create a work of art that reflects upon classical representations of Pocahontas and then fashion new portraits of her in unexpected ways. Adornment: Iconic Perceptions invites us to think about the way we view Native American history and art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttps://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=120378",

    "description": "Jonathan Kaiser’s “Inverse Echo” is an engaging sonic experience, a sculptural sound installation featuring a quartet of custom-made vinyl records on continuous repeat. Kaiser is interested in the tension between circular and linear conceptions of time, using looped records to explore the interconnection between past, present, and future. By varying the playback speed of the different records, he creates a perpetually shifting four-channel composition, evolving even as it repeats. The sculptural and spatial elements of the installation address related themes of symmetry and repetition. Kaiser is an internationally recognized musician and his one-person exhibition, “Blind Arcade,” was recently presented at the Rochester Art Center.<br />\n<br />\nJonathan Kaiser and Carolyn Swiszcz, January 15 - March 29, 2015<br />\n<br />\nMore information at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

But there's a certain magic in the air when the museum is empty—a creative hum that reverberates into infinity when no one's there to catch it. With that in mind, we took a tip from our friends at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and invited members of the local Instagram community into the empty museum to capture what's there when no one else is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow along on Instagram with hashtags #BDayMIA and #EmptyMIA as the journey through the empty halls of the MIA unfolds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecial thanks to (Instagram accounts):<br />\r\n@matt_trieber<br />\r\n@mamacita.rita<br />\r\n@ericmueller<br />\r\n@christmaselk<br />\r\n@vivoarch<br />\r\n@paul_johnstone<br />\r\n@witanddelight_<br />\r\n@orbeq<br />\r\n@lizgardnermpls<br />\r\n@josefharris<br />\r\n@eliesajohnson<br />\r\n@sbakshian<br />\r\n@eric.husband<br />\r\n@danamarieku<br />\r\n@murrminks<br />\r\n@jpcaruso<br />\r\n@intao",

It was the values we had expressed in those structures that I sought and attempted to elicit in photographs and text.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Beginning in 1999—four years after the first democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to power—and continuing into the present, I have engaged in a similar photography of some of the structures that have emerged with our democracy and that I believe are expressive of values in this new, still nascent and yet in many ways old way of being in our society.
