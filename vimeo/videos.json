    "description": "Stan Douglas is a photographer, filmmaker, and installation artist whose works have been exhibited internationally, including in three Venice Biennials and three dOCUMENTAs. Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets. These pictures are meticulously composed down to the slightest gestures and period styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouglas was awarded the prestigious Infinity Award for Art by the International Center for Photography in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Arnold Neman Lecture Series is made possible thanks to a generous gift from the Arnold and Augusta Newman Foundation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerous support for New Pictures is provided by the W. Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Foundation.",

    "description": "Jones gained notoriety for photographing psychoanalysts' therapy rooms in the late 1990s and has continued to explore this provocative subject. In Analyst (Couch) (I), 2008, she shows the therapist's viewpoint: a banal-looking couch covered with a red blanket bears the imprint of the patient who lay upon it during a session. Arrangement (Analyst) (I), 2007, focuses on the objects that have been carefully arranged by the analyst to create a soothing environment for the patient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo large-scale diptychs—one showing a horse and the other a rose bush—refer to early stereographic prints and explore the potential for photography to reveal uncanny perspectives. In The Rose Gardens (display: III / white) (II) and (III), of 2008, Jones photographed a rose bush from both front and back so viewers can contemplate both viewpoints simultaneously. In Horse (profile / black) (II) and (III), of 2012, she paired two images of a horse, whose majestic presence is compressed through the process of doubling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJones earned her master of fine arts degree at Goldsmith College in London and has been exhibiting internationally for over twenty years. She is represented by Maureen Paley, London, and Anton Kern Gallery, New York, and is also a tutor at The Royal College of Art in London. A new monograph published by Violette Editions, with contributions by David Campany, Brian Dillon, and A. M. Homes, is now available in bookshops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic credit: \"White Lotus\" by Kevin Macleod",

    "description": "Artist and bookmaker Chad Rutter explores American material and cultural geography through a wide range of media, including photography and sculpture. Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. Rutter is a recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative grant and is the publisher of Mystery Spot books.

    "description": "The new sculptures in Amy Toscani's CHASTUSHKI exhibition have been carefully churned through her distinctly Midwestern aesthetic, which is to say she draws equally from thrift-store treasures, her wry sense of humor, and found sculptures that can also be described as \"suburban sublime.\" For those familiar with her work, these new pieces will show her important shift to working on a human scale and more quickly. Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic. Toscani is a recent recipient of the McKnight Artist Fellowship and has had numerous one-person and group shows, most recently at Rosalux Gallery in Minneapolis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChad Rutter and Amy Toscani Exhibition Dates: April 18 - June 29, 2014<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/amy-toscani-and-chad-rutter/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) is a curatorial program of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) dedicated to exhibiting and supporting artists living and working in the state of Minnesota. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

    "description": "In this exhibition, simply titled \"Sacred,\" curators have assembled art from every corner of the world. Although these works span time, distance, and disparate cultures, they share an evolving sense of the sacred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the ten galleries in the exhibition features an installation or \"mini-show\" designed around different themes or narratives inspired by the word \"sacred.\" Conventionally used to describe something or someone imbued with divinity, the word has evolved as societies have become more diverse and secular. What's sacred today? The word hinges on the speaker: what is sacred is often very personal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the objects in these galleries were never intended for display in a museum. Taken out of their usual contexts, they ask to be seen differently, posing provocative questions about what is sacred. How does their presence here change our perception of them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these juxtapositions, you can explore historical and contemporary expressions of the divine, the spiritual, the essential, and the beloved while reflecting on the meaning of the word \"sacred.\" What does it mean to you?",

    "description": "A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in magazines and books.",
