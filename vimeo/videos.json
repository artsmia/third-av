    "description": "Beautiful, rare, costly, and odd. For 600 years, the aristocratic Habsburg dynasty that ruled much of Europe amassed an unrivaled collection of art and antiquities   that reflected the family’s wealth and power. Jumbles of rock crystal, ivory, bronze, armament, coins, books, paintings, even animals, plants, and minerals from around the world initially were displayed in Kunstkammers— cabinets of art and wonders. How did these antique versions of massive China cabinets morph into the modern museum?<br />\n<br />\nSabine Haag, PhD, director of Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum, will enchant us with stories of Habsburg emperors, queens, and their emissaries, and will reveal how their collecting obsessions grew into the world-renowned Kunstkammer Vienna that delights us today.",

By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is glimpsing past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language; however, they also show Holmberg’s interest in concepts of absence, transparency, and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, particularly his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture illuminates how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

Feeling.” Grand Unified Theory (G.U.T.) is a new photographic installation that revels in the ardent striving of science’s grandest theories—the search by fringe and mainstream scientists alike for a single elegant explanation of the universe. Images from his own scientific experiments and found footage bridge the gap between epic and mundane, suggestive of grand ideas without proving a thing. Two gallery-length tables emphasize the connection between his photographs and the wonderfully obsolete technologies once used to visualize scientific observation. A future installment of Carroll’s “G.U.T. Feeling” will appear in McSweeney‘s in 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

    "description": "What's beneath our feet—and the museum? Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/event/beneath-the-ground/<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/the-nature-of-nature/beneath-the-ground/",

    "description": "Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt traces the elusive sources of Michelangelo’s genius, having explored his artistic origins while cracking the mystery of a curious artwork. For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.",
