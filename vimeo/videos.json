The guest curator and world-renowned English culinary historian will create a full banquet in the Tudor Room, the museum's first period room. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIvan Day is best known for his museum exhibitions of re-created historic table settings and is considered to be one of the foremost authorities in this field. Having started collecting antiquarian cookery books and culinary utensils when he was only 13, Day now has 40 years' experience of both cooking and making replicas of period food. He will re-create an intimate banquet, as the dessert course was known in 17th-century England, especially for the MIA's Tudor Room.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVideo by Ryan Lee<br />\r\nMusic: \"Handel - Entrance to the Queen of Sheba for Two Oboes, Strings, and Continuo allegro\" (by Advent Chamber Orchestra) www.freemusicarchive.org",

Within the context of a museum exhibition, however, Curator's Office also becomes a \"period room,\" an installation of objects, furnishings, and architecture meant to illustrate a historical moment by re-creating its interior domestic spaces. Period rooms are popular museum attractions that are both authentic (in their contents) and false (in their detachment from their original contexts.)",

Presented each fall and spring, the series highlights the vital experimentations in photography and new media undertaken by artists who grapple with making images that address today's culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurunishi, who was born in Kobe, Japan, and lives in Los Angeles, uses a large-format 4 x 5 camera to make several film images of geographical sites in the United States. Each image represents a different point of view, typically including one with a span from the tip of the artists toes into the foreground and landscape. After selecting four to six images, Furunishi scans the negatives onto a computer and then digitally stitches them together with Adobe Photoshop to create seemingly continuous landscapes. A close look reveals that some images have been flipped upside down or rearranged within the composition. The vertical orientation of Furunishi's photographs recalls the complex formal compositions of historical Chinese and Japanese hanging scroll paintings, providing a contemporary perspective on the MIA's renowned Asian collection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurunishi's photographs suggest the new visual conditions and technological possibilities of our own time through their subtly warped vistas, which upend preconceptions about the land beneath our feet and the skies overhead.",

Presented each fall and spring, New Pictures highlights the vital experimentations in photography and new media undertaken by artists who grapple with making images that address today's culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreuer's works invite close inspection of their complex and delicate surfaces, colors, and forms. At the same time, they challenge our assumptions by raising the question \"What is a photograph?\" Breuer omits the two elements most commonly associated with photographs: the camera and a representational picture of the world. By sanding, scraping, burning, embossing, and cutting the light-sensitive surface of the photographic paper, he emphasizes the medium's fundamental elements: light-sensitive photographic paper, and light. In the end, Breuer's images are not just pictures, they are physical marks of the material world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo capture the complexity of Breuer's approach to photography, a second edition of \"New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer\" will be on view starting March 12. At that time, the artist will alter the space to evoke a darkroom and will create a site-specific installation addressing the relationship between photography and drawing.",

    "description": "The third exhibition in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' new photography series presents the innovative work of Los Angeles photographer James Welling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"New Pictures 3: James Welling, Glass House\" showcases an elegant photographic series of Philip Johnson's modernist architectural masterpiece, Glass House (1949).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a digital camera and color filters, Welling experiments with new possibilities for architectural photography, capturing the luminous effects of Johnson's glass-skinned structure at different times and with changing light conditions over a three-year period (2006--2008.) These atmospheric works reveal the ambiguity between the interior built space and exterior natural space evoked by Johnson's home. These pictures suggest a physical experience of space and form that is unique in architectural photography.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJames Welling has been producing groundbreaking work since the 1970s that possesses a rare combination of conceptual depth and technical skill. Through the last three decades, he continues to challenge himself as a photographer and offers viewers new discoveries through thoughtful and visually arresting photographs that suggest overlooked aspects of the medium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the last five years, he has taken on the challenge of architecture and produced a body of work that offers a new take on representations of architecture within a natural site. His experimental use of color and light to explore spatiality makes him a particularly important artist to feature in the MIA's 'New Pictures' series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelling, a professor in the Department of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles, first gained national recognition in the 1970s and 1980s for his carefully staged black-and-white photographs employing such unconventional mediums as pastry dough, gelatin, and tinfoil. These early works spoke to the role of the photographer in staging the vision and narrative of each picture. Welling's work has been exhibited internationally and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition, \"James Welling Photographs, 1974--1999.\"",

    "description": "The fourth edition of \"New Pictures,\" a semi-annual series dedicated to showcasing vital experiments in photography and new media by artists from around the world, features a selection of photographs by Angela Strassheim from her series Evidence. These pictures draw on photography's historical association with images of death. In the late 19th century, families often took pictures of deceased children and loved ones to preserve their memories. At the same time, homicide detectives, lawyers, and journalists have long used photographs as evidence of murders and other crimes. Employing forensic techniques to record domestic interiors where murders have taken place in New York, Massachusetts, and Minneapolis, Strassheim merges these two deeply rooted themes of memory and crime in her images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the M.F.A. program at Yale University, Strassheim received training and a certificate in forensic photography. During a six-year period between her undergraduate and graduate studies, she earned a living as a forensic photographer, taking pictures of crime scenes and autopsies. Since 2009, she has applied this on-the-job experience to produce Evidence, a more nuanced and less scientific examination of domestic crime. These photographs reveal the eerie vestiges of past lives in homes that are now inhabited by new families. To contextualize the long history of photography with the genre of crime and murder, the exhibition also features a display of photographs from local historical collections.",

    "description": "A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained 80 photographs of mushrooms, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of the Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford's pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities. Fulford's images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, and relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. His work is now on view in \"New Pictures 5\" in Gallery 262.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulford is a photographer and co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles. He has lectured widely, and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in magazines and books.",

Although these works span time, distance, and disparate cultures, they share an evolving sense of the sacred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the ten galleries in the exhibition features an installation or \"mini-show\" designed around different themes or narratives inspired by the word \"sacred.\" Conventionally used to describe something or someone imbued with divinity, the word has evolved as societies have become more diverse and secular. What's sacred today? The word hinges on the speaker: what is sacred is often very personal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the objects in these galleries were never intended for display in a museum. Taken out of their usual contexts, they ask to be seen differently, posing provocative questions about what is sacred. How does their presence here change our perception of them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these juxtapositions, you can explore historical and contemporary expressions of the divine, the spiritual, the essential, and the beloved while reflecting on the meaning of the word \"sacred.\" What does it mean to you?",

Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape.

In Analyst (Couch) (I), 2008, she shows the therapist's viewpoint: a banal-looking couch covered with a red blanket bears the imprint of the patient who lay upon it during a session. Arrangement (Analyst) (I), 2007, focuses on the objects that have been carefully arranged by the analyst to create a soothing environment for the patient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo large-scale diptychs—one showing a horse and the other a rose bush—refer to early stereographic prints and explore the potential for photography to reveal uncanny perspectives. In The Rose Gardens (display: III / white) (II) and (III), of 2008, Jones photographed a rose bush from both front and back so viewers can contemplate both viewpoints simultaneously. In Horse (profile / black) (II) and (III), of 2012, she paired two images of a horse, whose majestic presence is compressed through the process of doubling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJones earned her master of fine arts degree at Goldsmith College in London and has been exhibiting internationally for over twenty years.

    "description": "Stan Douglas is a photographer, filmmaker, and installation artist whose works have been exhibited internationally, including in three Venice Biennials and three dOCUMENTAs. Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets. These pictures are meticulously composed down to the slightest gestures and period styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouglas was awarded the prestigious Infinity Award for Art by the International Center for Photography in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Arnold Neman Lecture Series is made possible thanks to a generous gift from the Arnold and Augusta Newman Foundation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerous support for New Pictures is provided by the W.

    "description": "Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt traces the elusive sources of Michelangelo’s genius, having explored his artistic origins while cracking the mystery of a curious artwork. For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.",

    "description": "What's beneath our feet—and the museum? Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.",

Feeling.” Grand Unified Theory (G.U.T.) is a new photographic installation that revels in the ardent striving of science’s grandest theories—the search by fringe and mainstream scientists alike for a single elegant explanation of the universe. Images from his own scientific experiments and found footage bridge the gap between epic and mundane, suggestive of grand ideas without proving a thing. Two gallery-length tables emphasize the connection between his photographs and the wonderfully obsolete technologies once used to visualize scientific observation. A future installment of Carroll’s “G.U.T. Feeling” will appear in McSweeney‘s in 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is glimpsing past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language; however, they also show Holmberg’s interest in concepts of absence, transparency, and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, particularly his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture illuminates how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

This talk by longtime New Yorker writer, art critic, and book author Adam Gopnik examines the ways in which the modernist movement—at its apogee of innovation in literature, visual arts, and music—was reshaped and destroyed by The Great War. Gopnik will investigate how the catastrophic collision of European powers ripped apart the early twentieth-century’s optimistic cultural life and progressive civilization in ways that only began to be reconstituted and restored in our own time, 100 years later.",

There were “secrets” in Gaudi’s design, the basilica’s two octogenarian architects told Burry in 1977 when he started. Every aspect of Gaudi’s complex design took shape in his head. But it has taken software designed for the aerospace industry to bring his innovations in acoustics, structure, color, and light to fruition. Burry will describe the cultural enrichment that comes from such a transcendent project.",

    "description": "Who better than an internationally renowned Habsburg to speak about the eccentricities and collecting fervor of the dynasty that ruled Europe for over 600 years? Géza von Habsburg will offer an “insider” view of the Habsburg royals, beginning with Emperor Maximilian I around 1500, the first to use family wealth and art to elevate the status of the House of Austria. Emperor Rudolph II (1552-1612), famed for his spendthrift ways and neglect of state affairs, was so obsessed with obtaining rare art objects that he literally lost the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia, and very nearly his title of Holy Roman Emperor. Yet, the glories of such extensive collections led to formation of today’s Kunstkammer in Vienna, from which the MIA will receive treasures for its next great exhibition, “The Habsburgs: Rarely Seen Masterpieces from Europe’s Greatest Dynasty.” Dr. von Habsburg brings us stories of these captivating royals and their exquisite objets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamed for his expertise on Fabergé, Dr. von Habsburg has written and curated extensively on this subject. He was Chairman of Christie’s in Europe for 18 years, specializing in Old Master paintings and the applied arts. He has taught at the New York School of Interior Design, at the Bard Graduate Center for the Decorative Art, at New York University, and lectures worldwide. He is currently a visiting professor at Okinawa University in Japan and serves on the vetting committees of numerous international art fairs. Dr. von Habsburg is the great, great grandson of Emperor Franz-Joseph of Austria and grandson of King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony.",

It focuses particularly on the three periods of their greatest flourishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first relates the history of the Habsburgs from the dynasty’s origins in the 13th century until the 16th century. The central figure is Maximilian I, during whose reign the Habsburgs achieved world-power status. You’ll see how an international network of political and family relations aided in the amassing of unique collections of art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevoted to the Age of the Baroque, the second block explores the art, culture, and politics of the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period the House of Habsburg dies out in both Spanish and Austrian male lines, provoking considerable political complications and the loss of Spain. A female heiress, Maria Theresa, succeeded in establishing her right to rule as heir to the Austrian line, becoming the final ruler of the House of Habsburg. Visitors will discover the role of religion, art, and court festivities as instruments propagating the dynasty’s self‐image and claim to rule. Key figures include Leopold Wilhelm, Leopold I, Charles VI, and Maria Theresa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early 19th century saw the final demise of the Holy Roman Empire and the establishment of the hereditary Austrian Empire. With the growth of nationalism, the empire would be transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria‐Hungary. Key figures of this period are Francis II (I) and Franz Joseph. This section explores the long reign of Emperor Franz Joseph, the founding of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and the creation of the multinational empire. This empire, characterized by a highly hierarchical social order, is represented by the lavish gowns of the imperial court. At the end of World War I in 1918, it dissolved into its component parts, bringing almost 600 years of Habsburg rule in Europe to an end.",

    "description": "“In the 1980s and 90s I photographed structures that we South Africans had made during the Era of Baasskap—that time, from about 1660 until 1990, in which Whites gradually came to exert dominion over all of South Africa and its peoples. It was the values we had expressed in those structures that I sought and attempted to elicit in photographs and text.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Beginning in 1999—four years after the first democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to power—and continuing into the present, I have engaged in a similar photography of some of the structures that have emerged with our democracy and that I believe are expressive of values in this new, still nascent and yet in many ways old way of being in our society. The photographs exhibited here are from these two separate yet intimately connected bodies of work.”<br />\r\n—David Goldblatt, July 2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew Pictures 10, David Goldblatt: Structures of Dominion and Democracy in South Africa, August 21, 2014 - March 8, 2015",

    "description": "Exhibition Dates: February 15 - May 10, 2015<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet tickets here: ow.ly/IXwSL.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis sweeping exhibition showcases the amazing history of the Austrian Habsburg Emperors, who commissioned and collected households full of masterpieces by which to display their power. It focuses particularly on the three periods of their greatest flourishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first relates the history of the Habsburgs from the dynasty’s origins in the 13th century until the 16th century. The central figure is Maximilian I, during whose reign the Habsburgs achieved world-power status. You’ll see how an international network of political and family relations aided in the amassing of unique collections of art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevoted to the Age of the Baroque, the second block explores the art, culture, and politics of the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period the House of Habsburg dies out in both Spanish and Austrian male lines, provoking considerable political complications and the loss of Spain. A female heiress, Maria Theresa, succeeded in establishing her right to rule as heir to the Austrian line, becoming the final ruler of the House of Habsburg. Visitors will discover the role of religion, art, and court festivities as instruments propagating the dynasty’s self‐image and claim to rule. Key figures include Leopold Wilhelm, Leopold I, Charles VI, and Maria Theresa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early 19th century saw the final demise of the Holy Roman Empire and the establishment of the hereditary Austrian Empire. With the growth of nationalism, the empire would be transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria‐Hungary. Key figures of this period are Francis II (I) and Franz Joseph. This section explores the long reign of Emperor Franz Joseph, the founding of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and the creation of the multinational empire. This empire, characterized by a highly hierarchical social order, is represented by the lavish gowns of the imperial court. At the end of World War I in 1918, it dissolved into its component parts, bringing almost 600 years of Habsburg rule in Europe to an end.",

    "description": "Jonathan Kaiser’s “Inverse Echo” is an engaging sonic experience, a sculptural sound installation featuring a quartet of custom-made vinyl records on continuous repeat. Kaiser is interested in the tension between circular and linear conceptions of time, using looped records to explore the interconnection between past, present, and future. By varying the playback speed of the different records, he creates a perpetually shifting four-channel composition, evolving even as it repeats. The sculptural and spatial elements of the installation address related themes of symmetry and repetition. Kaiser is an internationally recognized musician and his one-person exhibition, “Blind Arcade,” was recently presented at the Rochester Art Center.<br />\n<br />\nJonathan Kaiser and Carolyn Swiszcz, January 15 - March 29, 2015<br />\n<br />\nMore information at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

    "description": "Most people associate artist and architect Maya Lin with her very first, very public creation—the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial, in Washington, D.C.—which she designed at age 21, while still a Yale undergraduate. By cutting open the land and polishing the gabbro stone edges to create a history embedded in the earth, Lin redefined the idea of public monument. Since 1981, she has gone on to even greater innovation: acclaimed large-scale environmental installations, intimate studio artworks, architectural works, and memorials. Lin will give the Friends audience an intimate glimpse into how her artwork interprets the world through a 21st century lens, utilizing technological methods to study and visualize the natural environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFriends Lecture Series 2014–15<br />\r\nSponsored by the Mark and Mary Goff Fiterman Lecture Fund",

    "description": "In 1879, James McNeill Whistler was down on his luck. A gallery owner rescued him with a commission to go to Venice to produce a dozen etchings. There, watery reflections of ancient architecture and atmospheric light provided endless inspiration suited to the artist’s loose treatment of form. He fell in love with the city and stayed for more than a year, producing over fifty etchings plus many other works of art. Nocturne: Palaces is among the most poetic of his Venetian creations. This is an exceptionally early proof, taken after his first retouching of the plate with his drypoint needle. He printed it himself. Leaving a carefully modulated veil of ink on the surface of the copper printing plate and printing it on antique paper, he produced magically luminous effects of light. Whistler called the image a nocturne to emphasize his intention to produce “an artistic arrangement” rather than a topographical depiction. Indeed, scholars have been unable to locate the place of this view, which may have existed primarily in Whistler’s imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttps://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=120316",

    "description": "Yes, this is contemporary Native American art! Yellow gold, brilliant cut diamonds, silk knotted pearl strings with indigenous wampum, and fresh water pearls surround miniature portraits of Pocahontas (1596-1617). Working collaboratively to bring fellow Native American woman Pocahontas to life, artists Jamie Okuma and Keri Ataumbi found inspiration in historical depictions of this iconic figure; the 1616 engraving by Simon Van De Passe and the classic 1852 painting by Thomas Sully. In the style of 16th century Jacobean portraiture, Okuma depicts Pocahontas using beads on buckskin as her canvas, and Ataumbi uses precious metals and stones to frame to frame the piece. Take a peek at the back of the ring—it too has a portrait! Ataumbi and Okuma create a work of art that reflects upon classical representations of Pocahontas and then fashion new portraits of her in unexpected ways. Adornment: Iconic Perceptions invites us to think about the way we view Native American history and art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttps://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=120378",
