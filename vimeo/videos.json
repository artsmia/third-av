    "description": "Exhibition Dates: February 15 - May 10, 2015<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet tickets here: ow.ly/IXwSL.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis sweeping exhibition showcases the amazing history of the Austrian Habsburg Emperors, who commissioned and collected households full of masterpieces by which to display their power. It focuses particularly on the three periods of their greatest flourishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first relates the history of the Habsburgs from the dynasty’s origins in the 13th century until the 16th century. The central figure is Maximilian I, during whose reign the Habsburgs achieved world-power status. You’ll see how an international network of political and family relations aided in the amassing of unique collections of art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevoted to the Age of the Baroque, the second block explores the art, culture, and politics of the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period the House of Habsburg dies out in both Spanish and Austrian male lines, provoking considerable political complications and the loss of Spain. A female heiress, Maria Theresa, succeeded in establishing her right to rule as heir to the Austrian line, becoming the final ruler of the House of Habsburg. Visitors will discover the role of religion, art, and court festivities as instruments propagating the dynasty’s self‐image and claim to rule. Key figures include Leopold Wilhelm, Leopold I, Charles VI, and Maria Theresa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early 19th century saw the final demise of the Holy Roman Empire and the establishment of the hereditary Austrian Empire. With the growth of nationalism, the empire would be transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria‐Hungary. Key figures of this period are Francis II (I) and Franz Joseph. This section explores the long reign of Emperor Franz Joseph, the founding of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and the creation of the multinational empire. This empire, characterized by a highly hierarchical social order, is represented by the lavish gowns of the imperial court. At the end of World War I in 1918, it dissolved into its component parts, bringing almost 600 years of Habsburg rule in Europe to an end.",

    "description": "Who better than an internationally renowned Habsburg to speak about the eccentricities and collecting fervor of the dynasty that ruled Europe for over 600 years? Géza von Habsburg will offer an “insider” view of the Habsburg royals, beginning with Emperor Maximilian I around 1500, the first to use family wealth and art to elevate the status of the House of Austria. Emperor Rudolph II (1552-1612), famed for his spendthrift ways and neglect of state affairs, was so obsessed with obtaining rare art objects that he literally lost the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia, and very nearly his title of Holy Roman Emperor. Yet, the glories of such extensive collections led to formation of today’s Kunstkammer in Vienna, from which the MIA will receive treasures for its next great exhibition, “The Habsburgs: Rarely Seen Masterpieces from Europe’s Greatest Dynasty.” Dr. von Habsburg brings us stories of these captivating royals and their exquisite objets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamed for his expertise on Fabergé, Dr. von Habsburg has written and curated extensively on this subject. He was Chairman of Christie’s in Europe for 18 years, specializing in Old Master paintings and the applied arts. He has taught at the New York School of Interior Design, at the Bard Graduate Center for the Decorative Art, at New York University, and lectures worldwide. He is currently a visiting professor at Okinawa University in Japan and serves on the vetting committees of numerous international art fairs. Dr. von Habsburg is the great, great grandson of Emperor Franz-Joseph of Austria and grandson of King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony.",

In addition, Griffiths founded and directs Ripple Effect Images, a collective of photographers who donate their images to benefit programs that empower women and girls throughout the developing world, especially as they deal with the devastating effects of climate change.",

The themes of life and death, both real and virtual, are repeated throughout his work, as seen in his use of traditional memento mori, such as funerary reliefs and vanitas paintings. It may appear that the bricks and hero’s face in “When You’re Dead, You’re Dead” are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously hand painted. Gallery walls covered floor to ceiling with sheets of 16-bit brick vinyl wallpaper will complement the paintings.<br />\n<br />\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

His chaotic installations draw from his stockpile of holiday ephemera, which includes miles of wrapping paper and dozens of Christmas tree skirts. Obscure religious iconography is layered throughout the wall collages and sculptures, creating a riot of patterning and appropriated symbolism that find the divine in throwaway materials. The exhibition title, Delta Delta Delta Force, connotes secret letter and military organizations that have their own initiation rites and symbolism.

Here’s your chance to ask the architect faced with that challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor over three decades, Australian architect Mark Burry has devoted his career to untangling the mysteries left in Antoni Gaudi’s masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which was less than one-quarter done when he died in 1926. There were “secrets” in Gaudi’s design, the basilica’s two octogenarian architects told Burry in 1977 when he started. Every aspect of Gaudi’s complex design took shape in his head. But it has taken software designed for the aerospace industry to bring his innovations in acoustics, structure, color, and light to fruition. Burry will describe the cultural enrichment that comes from such a transcendent project.",

This talk by longtime New Yorker writer, art critic, and book author Adam Gopnik examines the ways in which the modernist movement—at its apogee of innovation in literature, visual arts, and music—was reshaped and destroyed by The Great War. Gopnik will investigate how the catastrophic collision of European powers ripped apart the early twentieth-century’s optimistic cultural life and progressive civilization in ways that only began to be reconstituted and restored in our own time, 100 years later.",
