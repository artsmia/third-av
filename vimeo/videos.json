    "description": "As one of the first women photographers to work for National Geographic, Annie Griffiths is known for her ability to capture inspiring human moments through photographs from nearly 150 countries. Motherhood didn’t slow her down; from the time her children were infants, Griffiths took them on assignments from Jerusalem to the Galapagos, then captured the family’s experiences in her book A Camera, Two Kids and a Camel. In addition, Griffiths founded and directs Ripple Effect Images, a collective of photographers who donate their images to benefit programs that empower women and girls throughout the developing world, especially as they deal with the devastating effects of climate change.",

The themes of life and death, both real and virtual, are repeated throughout his work, as seen in his use of traditional memento mori, such as funerary reliefs and vanitas paintings. It may appear that the bricks and hero’s face in “When You’re Dead, You’re Dead” are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously hand painted. Gallery walls covered floor to ceiling with sheets of 16-bit brick vinyl wallpaper will complement the paintings.<br />\n<br />\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

His chaotic installations draw from his stockpile of holiday ephemera, which includes miles of wrapping paper and dozens of Christmas tree skirts.

The exhibition title, Delta Delta Delta Force, connotes secret letter and military organizations that have their own initiation rites and symbolism.

Here’s your chance to ask the architect faced with that challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor over three decades, Australian architect Mark Burry has devoted his career to untangling the mysteries left in Antoni Gaudi’s masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which was less than one-quarter done when he died in 1926. There were “secrets” in Gaudi’s design, the basilica’s two octogenarian architects told Burry in 1977 when he started. Every aspect of Gaudi’s complex design took shape in his head. But it has taken software designed for the aerospace industry to bring his innovations in acoustics, structure, color, and light to fruition. Burry will describe the cultural enrichment that comes from such a transcendent project.",

Gopnik will investigate how the catastrophic collision of European powers ripped apart the early twentieth-century’s optimistic cultural life and progressive civilization in ways that only began to be reconstituted and restored in our own time, 100 years later.",

By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is glimpsing past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language; however, they also show Holmberg’s interest in concepts of absence, transparency, and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, particularly his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture illuminates how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",

The selection of drawings, watercolors, gouaches, and pastels dating from the Middle Ages to the present day includes stellar examples by such masters as Guercino, Annibale Carracci, George Romney, François Boucher, Thomas Gainsborough, Edgar Degas, Käthe Kollwitz, Egon Schiele, Emil Nolde, Amedeo Modigliani, Henri Matisse, Alfredo Ramos Martínez, Roy Lichtenstein, and Ed Ruscha.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis eye-opening exhibition illuminates the historical and ongoing role of drawing as a means of study, observation, and problem solving, as an outpouring of the artist’s imagination, and as a method of realizing a finished work of art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSee here for more information: http://new.artsmia.org/marks-of-genius/",

    "description": "What's beneath our feet—and the museum? Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: <br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/event/beneath-the-ground/<br />\r\nhttp://new.artsmia.org/the-nature-of-nature/beneath-the-ground/",
