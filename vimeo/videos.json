    "description": "What's beneath our feet—and the museum? Monica Haller, the MIA's current artist-in-residence, became curious aboust these questions when her father removed piles of soil from a family property near Albertville several years ago. That gesture was the starting point for intriguing discussions about soil, and digging down into it, to discover geological and sociological histories. During her residency the project has grown, as Haller has made strong connections with researchers at the University of Minnesota, studying samples of Minnesota soil for years, and at the Minnesota Geological Survey, which maps the state's geological history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaller uses scientific data and soil samples to find new ways to understand artworks in the MIA's collection. Her particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors' thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground. Her new commission, a series of soil sample \"monoliths,\" will be installed throughout the museum; it will be accompanied by docent-led tours to explore the topic further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is made possible by a grant from Institute of Museum and Library Services.",

    "description": "Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt traces the elusive sources of Michelangelo’s genius, having explored his artistic origins while cracking the mystery of a curious artwork. For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.",

    "description": "Stan Douglas is a photographer, filmmaker, and installation artist whose works have been exhibited internationally, including in three Venice Biennials and three dOCUMENTAs. Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets. These pictures are meticulously composed down to the slightest gestures and period styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouglas was awarded the prestigious Infinity Award for Art by the International Center for Photography in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Arnold Neman Lecture Series is made possible thanks to a generous gift from the Arnold and Augusta Newman Foundation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerous support for New Pictures is provided by the W.

In Analyst (Couch) (I), 2008, she shows the therapist's viewpoint: a banal-looking couch covered with a red blanket bears the imprint of the patient who lay upon it during a session. Arrangement (Analyst) (I), 2007, focuses on the objects that have been carefully arranged by the analyst to create a soothing environment for the patient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo large-scale diptychs—one showing a horse and the other a rose bush—refer to early stereographic prints and explore the potential for photography to reveal uncanny perspectives. In The Rose Gardens (display: III / white) (II) and (III), of 2008, Jones photographed a rose bush from both front and back so viewers can contemplate both viewpoints simultaneously. In Horse (profile / black) (II) and (III), of 2012, she paired two images of a horse, whose majestic presence is compressed through the process of doubling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJones earned her master of fine arts degree at Goldsmith College in London and has been exhibiting internationally for over twenty years. She is represented by Maureen Paley, London, and Anton Kern Gallery, New York, and is also a tutor at The Royal College of Art in London.

Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. Rutter is a recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative grant and is the publisher of Mystery Spot books.

    "description": "The new sculptures in Amy Toscani's CHASTUSHKI exhibition have been carefully churned through her distinctly Midwestern aesthetic, which is to say she draws equally from thrift-store treasures, her wry sense of humor, and found sculptures that can also be described as \"suburban sublime.\" For those familiar with her work, these new pieces will show her important shift to working on a human scale and more quickly. Since her use of art-historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic, she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. Cuccu began as a found sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion seamlessly transitioning into Toscani's sculpted, oversize lower body, a scale at once hilarious and pathetic.
