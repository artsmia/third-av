  "description": "Exhibition Dates: July 18 - September 28, 2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEric William Carroll presents the second installment of his ongoing project “G.U.T. Feeling.” Grand Unified Theory (G.U.T.) is a new photographic installation that revels in the ardent striving of science’s grandest theories—the search by fringe and mainstream scientists alike for a single elegant explanation of the universe. Images from his own scientific experiments and found footage bridge the gap between epic and mundane, suggestive of grand ideas without proving a thing. Two gallery-length tables emphasize the connection between his photographs and the wonderfully obsolete technologies once used to visualize scientific observation. A future installment of Carroll’s “G.U.T. Feeling” will appear in McSweeney‘s in 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",
