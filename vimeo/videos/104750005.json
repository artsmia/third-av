  "description": "Exhibition Dates: July 18 - September 28, 2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJames Holmberg believes that art gives form to human experience. By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is glimpsing past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language; however, they also show Holmberg’s interest in concepts of absence, transparency, and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, particularly his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture illuminates how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",
