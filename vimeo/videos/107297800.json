  "description": "Beautiful, rare, costly, and odd. For 600 years, the aristocratic Habsburg dynasty that ruled much of Europe amassed an unrivaled collection of art and antiquities   that reflected the family’s wealth and power. Jumbles of rock crystal, ivory, bronze, armament, coins, books, paintings, even animals, plants, and minerals from around the world initially were displayed in Kunstkammers— cabinets of art and wonders. How did these antique versions of massive China cabinets morph into the modern museum?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSabine Haag, PhD, director of Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum, will enchant us with stories of Habsburg emperors, queens, and their emissaries, and will reveal how their collecting obsessions grew into the world-renowned Kunstkammer Vienna that delights us today.",
