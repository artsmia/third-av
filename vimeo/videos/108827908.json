  "description": "In 1914, Europe was on the brink of committing suicide. This talk by longtime New Yorker writer, art critic, and book author Adam Gopnik examines the ways in which the modernist movement—at its apogee of innovation in literature, visual arts, and music—was reshaped and destroyed by The Great War. Gopnik will investigate how the catastrophic collision of European powers ripped apart the early twentieth-century’s optimistic cultural life and progressive civilization in ways that only began to be reconstituted and restored in our own time, 100 years later.",
