  "description": "Exhibition Dates: October 16 - December 28, 2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAndy Messerschmidt is an occultist who is fascinated by supernatural beliefs and the visual culture of mystical ceremonies. His chaotic installations draw from his stockpile of holiday ephemera, which includes miles of wrapping paper and dozens of Christmas tree skirts. Obscure religious iconography is layered throughout the wall collages and sculptures, creating a riot of patterning and appropriated symbolism that find the divine in throwaway materials. The exhibition title, Delta Delta Delta Force, connotes secret letter and military organizations that have their own initiation rites and symbolism. The gallery will be lit with a deep red glow, and a low delta wave hum will emphasize Messerschmidtâ€™s surreal, free-associative imagery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",
