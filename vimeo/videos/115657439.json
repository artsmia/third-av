  "description": "As one of the first women photographers to work for National Geographic, Annie Griffiths is known for her ability to capture inspiring human moments through photographs from nearly 150 countries. Motherhood didn’t slow her down; from the time her children were infants, Griffiths took them on assignments from Jerusalem to the Galapagos, then captured the family’s experiences in her book A Camera, Two Kids and a Camel. In addition, Griffiths founded and directs Ripple Effect Images, a collective of photographers who donate their images to benefit programs that empower women and girls throughout the developing world, especially as they deal with the devastating effects of climate change.",
