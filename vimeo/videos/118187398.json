  "description": "Carolyn Swiszcz’s paintings and linoleum prints of unpopulated streets put a humorous and sometimes eerie complexion on dozens of familiar St. Paul landmarks. The five new short videos in “Inventory,” which include actors, puppets and diegetic voices, are rendered in her irresistible style. A church and grocery store are just a few of the stages in Super Bowl Sunday, Pizza, and Shrine, each of which are based on poignantly personal vignettes from her Massachusetts hometown. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJonathan Kaiser and Carolyn Swiszcz, January 15 - March 29, 2015<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore information at: http://new.artsmia.org/exhibitions/maep/",
