  "description": "Every day (except Mondays, of course), the MIA is full of visitors, artists, students, and families...and we like it that way. But there's a certain magic in the air when the museum is emptyâ€”a creative hum that reverberates into infinity when no one's there to catch it. With that in mind, we took a tip from our friends at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and invited members of the local Instagram community into the empty museum to capture what's there when no one else is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow along on Instagram with hashtags #BDayMIA and #EmptyMIA as the journey through the empty halls of the MIA unfolds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecial thanks to (Instagram accounts):<br />\r\n@matt_trieber<br />\r\n@mamacita.rita<br />\r\n@ericmueller<br />\r\n@christmaselk<br />\r\n@vivoarch<br />\r\n@paul_johnstone<br />\r\n@witanddelight_<br />\r\n@orbeq<br />\r\n@lizgardnermpls<br />\r\n@josefharris<br />\r\n@eliesajohnson<br />\r\n@sbakshian<br />\r\n@eric.husband<br />\r\n@danamarieku<br />\r\n@murrminks<br />\r\n@jpcaruso<br />\r\n@intao",
