  "description": "Continuing in its quest to surprise and delight, and bring art outside the museum walls and into the community, MIA is creating a giant ice sculpture of a dragon to display in the public space next to Lake Calhoun in Uptown, starting this Friday, February 20.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA uniquely Minnesotan expression of what it means to inspire creativity and wonder in a place that is frozen for a significant part of the year, the dragon also symbolizes the MIAâ€™s world-renowned Asian art collection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTruly a one-of-a-kind installation of public art, this sculpture will only be around for a limited time (thank goodness!), so be sure to see if before it melts away.",
