  "description": "Most people associate artist and architect Maya Lin with her very first, very public creation—the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial, in Washington, D.C.—which she designed at age 21, while still a Yale undergraduate. By cutting open the land and polishing the gabbro stone edges to create a history embedded in the earth, Lin redefined the idea of public monument. Since 1981, she has gone on to even greater innovation: acclaimed large-scale environmental installations, intimate studio artworks, architectural works, and memorials. Lin will give the Friends audience an intimate glimpse into how her artwork interprets the world through a 21st century lens, utilizing technological methods to study and visualize the natural environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFriends Lecture Series 2014–15<br />\r\nSponsored by the Mark and Mary Goff Fiterman Lecture Fund",
