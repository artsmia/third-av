  "description": "Eros is a colossal bronze sculpture by the Polish-born artist Igor Mitoraj, who used the timeless artistic language of ancient Greece to address personal and contemporary issues in a new and original way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe arrival of Eros sparks an opportunity for community members to invest in the future of the MIA by donating any amount to its purchase. Our goal is to raise as least $1 million to bring this work into the collection. Donations large and small are happily accepted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore info: artsmia.org/eros",
