Less well known is its national and increasingly international stature as a publisher of exquisitely made prints. \"Highpoint Editions--Decade One\" celebrates its professional collaborations with fine artists of many stripes. The diversity and the quality testify to Highpoint's master printer, Cole Rogers, and his talented staff's ability to work with artists to realize their visions. The MIA is delighted to salute Highpoint and to present highlights from its production to a broad public audience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatured artists will include: Kinji Akagawa, Carlos Amorales, Carter, Santiago Cucullu, Mary Esch, Rob Fischer, Adam Helms, Joel Janowitz, Cameron Martin, Julie Mehretu, Clarence Morgan, Lisa Nankivil, Todd Norsten, Chloe Piene, Jessica Rankin, David Rathman, Carolyn Swiszcz, and others.",
