  "description": "Artist and bookmaker Chad Rutter explores American material and cultural geography through a wide range of media, including photography and sculpture. Floodplain is his first one-person show, carrying his interests forward while reflect his understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture, and exploration. Pond is a brand-new piece presenting a running text of Henry David Thoreau's Walden on a custom-programmed highway message board. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny three-line bits of text, Rutter's installation conflates the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. Rutter is a recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative grant and is the publisher of Mystery Spot books.
