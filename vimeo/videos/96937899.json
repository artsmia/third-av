  "description": "Stan Douglas is a photographer, filmmaker, and installation artist whose works have been exhibited internationally, including in three Venice Biennials and three dOCUMENTAs. Douglas's photographs examine how images and memory shape interpretations of history. To create his photographs, Douglas often assumes the role of a photojournalist who travels back in time to reinterpret key events in social and political history, such as the 1975 revolution in Angola and social riots in Canada during the 1930s and 1970s. After conducting intensive research, he restages these events using actors, costumes, props, and sets. These pictures are meticulously composed down to the slightest gestures and period styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouglas was awarded the prestigious Infinity Award for Art by the International Center for Photography in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Arnold Neman Lecture Series is made possible thanks to a generous gift from the Arnold and Augusta Newman Foundation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerous support for New Pictures is provided by the W. Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Foundation.",
