  "description": "Visual artist Nick Cave is a poet of sight, sound, motion and emotion, known for his larger-than-life “soundsuits,” mesmerizing hybrids of art and dance, made from scavenged and cast-off materials.  Since completing the MIA’s “Soundsuit” in 2010, Cave has achieved international prominence. One of Cave’s recent goals has been to nudge viewers from their work-a-day lethargy, lifting them to a place where they are free to dream again.",
