  "description": "Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt traces the elusive sources of Michelangelo’s genius, having explored his artistic origins while cracking the mystery of a curious artwork. For decades, a small marble statue of a boy archer stood in the grand foyer of the French Cultural Services townhouse on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A well-known art professor at New York University, Brandt had seen it many times. But only after the Renaissance scholar viewed it in good light at a reception did she realize it could be a lost work of a teenage Michelangelo. Her claim set off a firestorm among art historians but convinced the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where The Little Archer is now on loan.",
